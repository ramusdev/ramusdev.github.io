<h2>12. Your California Privacy Rights</h2>

Without being discriminated against for exercising these rights, California residents have the right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect from you, to delete that information, and to opt-out of the sale of your personal information, subject to certain restrictions. You also have the right to designate an agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. This section describes how to exercise those rights and our process for handling those requests.

Right to Request Access to Your Personal Information

California residents have the right to request, up to two times in a 12-month period, that we disclose the categories of your personal information we collect, use, and share. You may also request the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected from you. Please note that certain information may be exempt from such requests under California law.

Right to Request Deletion of Your Personal Information

You may also request that we delete personal information that we collected from you. Some information may be exempt from such requests under California law. For example, we need certain types of information so that we can provide our Properties to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use our Properties.

How to Exercise Your Access and Deletion Rights

California residents may exercise their California privacy rights by submitting your request to us here or sending an email to ccparequests@Ronin Group.com.

For security purposes, we will verify your identity – including requesting information from you – when you request to exercise your California privacy rights. If you have an online account you use to interact with Ronin Group, logging into your account will serve to verify your identity and request. We may request additional information if we believe your account has been compromised. If you do not have an account with us, or if we have reason to suspect that the security of your account is compromised, then we will request additional information from you to match with our existing records to verify your identity, depending on the nature of the request and the sensitivity of the information sought.

Once we have verified your identity (and your agent, as applicable), we will respond to your request as appropriate. If we are unable to complete your requests, we will provide you information about the reasons that we could not comply with your request.

Right to Nondiscrimination

We will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level of quality of goods or services if you choose to exercise these rights.

Sale of Personal Information

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), gives California residents the right to opt out of the sale of personal information.

We do not sell information that directly identifies you such as your name, telephone number, mailing address or email address.  We also do not provide customer personal information to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration.

We share certain information with third parties who do work on our behalf for the business purposes we describe above.

We also may allow third-party advertising companies to collect information about your activity on our websites and in our apps, for example through cookies, mobile ad identifiers, pixels, web beacons and social network plugins.  These advertising entities use information they collect to help us provide more relevant advertisements and for other purposes described in our Privacy Policy.  You can set up cookie controls and opt-out of advertising cookies, including third-party advertising cookies, by clicking here. You can also set up cookie controls through many browser settings and you can use industry-wide opt outs to control the use of cookies for interest-based advertising purposes.  You may also opt out through the settings page of Ronin Group mobile applications that may share your data for these purposes.  You can find additional information in the Mobile Advertising section above and in our Cookie Policy.

The personal information collected through these methods is associated with your browser or device, so if you would like to opt-out for this information you will need to disable cookies or trackers as described above. Because your opt-out preference is stored in a cookie, if you reset your advertising ID or clear your cookies then we will not recognize your device or your choices, so you must opt-out again.

In addition to the opt outs related to advertising above, we support the CCPA by allowing California residents to opt out of any other future sale of their personal information by clicking here. You can also submit a sale opt-out request by emailing us at ccparequests@Ronin Group.com.

Authorized Agents

You may also designate an agent to make requests to exercise your rights under the CCPA as described above. We will take steps both to verify the identity of the person seeking to exercise their rights as listed above, and to verify that your agent has been authorized to make a request on your behalf through providing us with a signed written authorization or a copy of a power of attorney.

California Shine the Light Law

Since 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not share our customer's personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes, without their approval. For inquiries regarding our disclosure policy, please send us an email to privacy@Ronin Group.com, or write us at: Ronin Group Publishing, Inc., 3100 Ocean Park Boulevard, Santa Monica, CA 90405 USA, ATTN: Privacy Team/Privacy Policy. We will be happy to honor your request.

California Privacy Rights for Minor Users

Since January 1, 2015, California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits you, if you are a California resident under the age of 18, to view, correct, or remove Information provided by you or publicly posted by you, by accessing your Ronin Group account or another product or service as applicable and editing/removing your Information. You will need your password to access your personal account. You may also send us an email asking us to remove certain posted content at privacy@Ronin Group.com. In the alternative, you may write to us at Ronin Group Publishing, Inc., 3100 Ocean Park Boulevard, Santa Monica, CA 90405 USA, ATTN: Privacy Team/Privacy Policy.

We will be happy to review, update or remove Information and/or content as appropriate. Residual copies of Information and/or content that have been removed from your account and/or the Properties may remain in our backup systems for approximately one month. We may still retain your Information to resolve disputes, enforce our user agreement, or comply with legal requirements; in this case, your personal information will be blocked from use for any other purpose.

Do Not Track

California Business and Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) permits our customers who are California residents to be informed as to how Ronin Group responds to Web browser "Do Not Track" settings. As Do Not Track is a standard that is currently being developed, Ronin Group does not take actions to respond to Do Not Track settings, and instead we adhere to the standards set out in this Privacy Policy.

<h2>13. Privacy Information for Nevada Residents</h2>

Under Nevada law, Nevada residents who have purchased goods or services from us may opt out of the “sale” of “covered information” (as such terms are defined under Nevada law) for monetary consideration to a person for that person to license or sell such information to additional persons. “Covered information” includes first and last name, address, email address, and phone number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online. As discussed above, we share your information with certain third parties that we believe can provide you with offers and promotions for products and service of interest to you and in the other ways described above. We do not believe that our sharing in this regard would qualify as a sale under Nevada law. Nonetheless, if you are a Nevada resident who has purchased goods or services from us, you may submit a request to record your preference to opt out by emailing us at individualrights@Ronin Group.com. Please note we may take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request.

<h2>14. Users in the EEA</h2>

As set out in more detail below, we only process or transfer your personal information where we can rely on legal grounds and appropriate safeguards to do so. You also have additional rights regarding your personal information if you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). 


<h2>15. Disclosure to Users Outside the US and the EEA</h2>

In addition, if you are a visitor to our websites or other online products and services from outside the U.S., the personal information you provide will be collected, processed and stored directly on, or transferred to, servers in the United States or other countries where Ronin Group group companies or our other partners or vendors maintain facilities or business operations.

No matter where the Information is located, Ronin Group takes commercially reasonable measures to safeguard your privacy rights in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the collection, processing, storage and transfer of your Information, please do not provide your Information when requested and stop using our websites and other online products and services.
