Before opening her popular modding shop on Gaea, Ramya Parekh (Rampart for short) made a name for herself in the underground gauntlet circuit. Parekh climbed to the top showcasing pure skill using her custom-modded gear. She began taking jobs from smugglers, Syndicate members, and everyone in between.

Some say it ain’t great unless it’s got “Rampart” written on it.<br><br>

Parekh never shied away from letting people know how great she was, or better yet, how bad they were. Maybe that’s what led a group of assailants to ambush her at her shop one night.<br><br>

Her business burned down and she was left with nothing -- except an Apex Card. For Parekh, the Apex card is more than just an invitation to compete - it's a sign that she may have lost her shop, but she didn't lose what built it. Like her motto says, she's the kind of person who can always "turn crap into gold.”<br><br>
