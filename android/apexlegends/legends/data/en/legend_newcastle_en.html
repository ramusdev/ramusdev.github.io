Lamont Craig wasn’t like other dads in the neighborhood. Sure, he dropped the kids off at school and acted out multiple voices every night for Story Time with his toddler. But Lamont had secrets—the first being his real name, Jackson Williams.<br><br>

A top soldier for the IMC, Jackson went AWOL when he ignored direct orders to fight what he believed was a losing battle. He knew he would never be safe from the remnants of the IMC--and neither would his sister, Anita, as long as she was with him.<br><br>

So when he was presumed dead in a ship explosion, he used that opportunity to leave his life behind, even if it meant leaving her behind too.
Years later, “Lamont” moved to an idyllic little town called Harris Valley, where he fell in love and got married.<br><br>

Harris Valley was so peaceful that they didn’t need law enforcement. All they needed was their knight, Newcastle. But the knight had secrets of his own: Newcastle had sold off the town to pay off his debts, and thugs from a gang called the Forgotten Families came to collect.<br><br>

They killed Newcastle when he couldn’t pay, unaware that Lamont was watching. He defeated them using his military acumen, but the Forgotten Families had plenty of reinforcements.<br><br>

So Lamont came up with a dangerous solution. With Newcastle’s armor, he could take on his identity and do what Newcastle could not: get into the Apex Games. With prize money like that, he could definitely pay off the debts.<br><br>

But not without the risk of being discovered by his little sister, the Apex Legend, Bangalore.
