In one of the backwoods towns in the desert, a series of strange events takes place. People are disappearing from farms on the outskirts, the district police are imposing a curfew, and eyewitnesses report numerous detachments of unmarked military personnel.

<h4>Plot</h4>

The Warface command is contacted by an anonymous person. He claims that in the hands of Blackwood were samples of an unknown life form from the ship of the Martian colonists, which was wrecked in Death Valley.<br><br>

Not far from the crash site, the Blackwood base was erected in the shortest possible time. But the creatures that were contained in its depths, broke out and now pose a danger to all living things. <br><br>

To eliminate the threat to the civilian population, one of the best Warface units, Sigma — 3, is sent to the region.<br><br>

<h4>Act 1</h4>
The operation begins on the outskirts of the military base. To get to it, you have to find three laptops with access codes. To activate laptops, you will need resources, boxes with which are scattered all over the map.<br><br>

<h4>Act 2</h4>
Once inside the complex, you will need to restore power to the central room access terminal. <br><br>

Here you will find an unexpected ally who will help you survive the descent to the lower levels.<br><br>

<h4>Act 3</h4>
To find out what controls the arachnids, you have to fight your way to the heart of the complex through dark, damp tunnels, fighting hordes of enemies. <br><br>

Take care of your new ally and he will take care of you in the final battle.<br><br>

<h4>Special operation Features</h4>

<h4>Entourage</h4>
Immerse yourself in the atmosphere of classic horror movies of the 80s!<br><br>

The pre-dawn haze will be the harbinger of a nightmare that you will face in reality. The utter darkness that reigns in the mysterious laboratories and damp tunnels of a creepy underground bunker will make you shudder at every rustle and shoot into the darkness.<br><br>

<h4>Boss</h4>
In the depths of the underground complex lurks what controls the arachnids. And this is something-colossal size, so prepare the biggest guns!<br><br>

Weapons. To fight arachnids protected by hard chitinous coverings, it is best to use a flamethrower! Endless ammunition will allow you to burn down entire hordes of bloodthirsty creatures.<br><br>

<h4>Ally</h4> 
Survive the descent into the lair itself will help an unexpected ally. Take care of him, and he will have your back in the final battle.<br><br>

New reward system. Passing a special operation for a certain time will bring a box with the most generous rewards!<br><br>

<h4>Flamethrower Hephaestus</h4>

Have you long dreamed of picking up a flamethrower and burning everything to the ground? Now you have such an opportunity!<br><br>

After reaching a certain progress of the mission, the player can pick up a flamethrower, which will significantly facilitate the destruction of arachnids and hives.<br><br>

The flamethrower has unlimited ammunition and does not need to be reloaded, if you do not allow overheating. In case of overheating, you will have to wait for some time until it is completely cooled down before you can shoot again.<br><br>

<h4>Resources</h4>

During the special operation, you will be able to receive Arenacoins resources. Each open box will give you 150 resources, and for finding a special laptop, you will get as many as 1000 resources!<br><br>

Using the earned resources, you will be able to restore your health, armor and ammo at certain points. In addition, the accumulated resources can be spent on various improvements to the machine.<br><br>

<h4>Samantha Combat Vehicle</h4>

Once inside the complex, you will need to restore power to the central room access terminal. Here you will find an unexpected ally who will help you survive the descent to the lower levels.<br><br>

Until the end of the mission, you will have to defend the car, but that's not all! At certain points it will be possible to improve the car: you will be able to install a turret, improve the armor or speed of the car.<br><br>
