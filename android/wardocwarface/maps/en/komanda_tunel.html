Map "Tunnel" for the "Team Battle" mode in the new setting based on the special operation "Swarm". On the "Tunnel" map, you can feel the atmosphere of the gloomy tunnels that were converted by Blackwood into a research base. Look around: dangerous opponents may be right behind you.<br><br>

In the "Tunnels", not everything is as safe as it seems. Warface and Blackwood will once again enter into a confrontation. The winner will gain control of the shelter, where previously conducted experiments on insects. The location provides a high intensity of combat at close and long distances. <br><br>

The team battle begins inside the tunnel behind its gates.<br><br>

The defending team starts the battle in the dead-end part of the railway tunnel, while the attacking team starts on the opposite side of the location behind the truck. Use flank areas to eliminate the threat in the form of a well-aimed sniper. <br><br>

In the center of the "Tunnel" — a massive truck, which can be an excellent position for the fire support of comrades. Don't forget to coordinate with the team: taking cover at this point, you will be vulnerable from the side positions.<br><br>
