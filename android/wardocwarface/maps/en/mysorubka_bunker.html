Bunker — games map PvP-mode "meat Grinder." Events take place in the rocket complex, located in Africa.<br><br>

Interesting map for battlefield fans any class. Here are long corridors and narrow passages, small rooms and open halls. Moreover, it is a multistory map, which ensures the variety of possible tactical decisions. Recommend you often to look around and to listen to suspicious sounds nearby. And, of course, try to launch a rocket!<br><br>

Here each fighter needs to stand up for itself and fight against all alone. The task of every soldier — to score the most points.<br><br>
