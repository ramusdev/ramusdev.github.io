Studio - a game map of the PvP-mode "Destruction". This time the action will unfold on the set in the scenery of the special operation "Mars". Was the mission to the Red Planet a hoax? We'll find out soon!<br><br>

As mentioned above, the "Studio" will differ in gameplay from the previous maps of the "Destruction" mode — new passages and advantageous positions will open up for the losing team.<br><br>

The map is divided into several zones, the main of which is the "Core", located in the center of the location. It is here that the most fierce battles will take place for the opportunity to activate pyrotechnic charges.<br><br>

After the first stage of the capture, the losing team will open a convenient sniper position on a hill, which will allow more effective control of open areas and the exit from the"Core".<br><br>

And after the second stage of destruction-access to the second floor of the "Core", which will make the gameplay even more intense.<br><br>

On one side of the "Core" is a long sandy area that is best suited for snipers and stormtroopers, and on the other-the scenery of Martian greenhouses, where engineers and doctors can prove themselves.<br><br>
