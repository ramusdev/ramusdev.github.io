Map "Residence" mode "Blitz" is a Oberon white residence located in the forest. In one of the rooms of the residence set the explosives. Fighting area is large enough: a lot of passes, descents in cellars and lifts to the upper floors, narrow circuitous routes and open spaces.<br><br>

To the main point, there are several passages in which the enemy tries to get to the explosives. This is a great place for an ambush! Pay special attention to the key points — try to take them before enemy, it will help turn the tide in your direction.<br><br>

The task of the attacking team — to prevent the explosion of a charge already laid at the site.<br><br>

The task of the defenders is to protect the explosives from abuse, eliminating the enemy team.<br><br>
