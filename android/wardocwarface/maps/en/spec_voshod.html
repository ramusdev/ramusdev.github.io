	Operation Blackwood in the Pacific could lead to a new disaster in space. Stop the enemy at all costs.



	<h4>Introduction</h4>



	According to information from an embedded operative with the call sign "Noda", the Blackwood Corporation is launching many unknown objects into space on one of the islands in the Pacific Ocean.<br><br>



	After learning about this, the Euroalliance leadership decides to send a fleet to the island and launch an assault, but as long as it is surrounded by an energy shield, an attack is impossible. <br><br>



	The Warface commando unit must land on the island, infiltrate the Blackwood base and disable the protective field, providing the Euroalliance troops with the opportunity to further advance.<br><br>

	<h4>New enemies</h4>



	Warface fighters will face extremely dangerous opponents, which you can defeat only by working together.<br><br>



	<b>SED-2</b><br> These Blackwood cybernetic soldiers have become even more deadly after being refined.<br><br>



	<b>Arsonist</b><br> A specially protected version of the SED-2 cyborgs, armed with a flamethrower. This enemy is able to set fire to the space around them, cutting off your squad's escape routes. Be especially careful!



	<h4>Passing stage 1</h4>



	The Allied fleet and air force are useless as long as there is a force field over the island. You are here to destroy the generator of this field.<br><br>



	Launcher for 12 hours. Blackwood delivers troops to Mars. What the colonists found cost them their lives. Remember the operation in Chernobyl? There began to produce cedrium after its reserves on the island ended.<br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_voshod_3.jpg"><br><br>



	I give you access to the Blackwood UAV. Remember the enemy's location and plan your attack. Shoot the patrolmen synchronously and quietly. Don't let them raise the alarm and call for backup. Okay, you can't do it quietly... rock ' n ' Roll! SED! Keep your distance!<br><br>



	Shoot with everything you have. When he falls, finish off with cold weapons.<br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_voshod_4.jpg"><br><br>



	Beautifully crafted, VEGA-5!



	<h4>Passing stage 2</h4>



	Many years ago, on this island, as well as in Chernobyl, there was a radiation accident. Now the nuclear power plant is restored and feeds the power shield along with the launcher.<br><br>



	Take up positions behind the shields! They will absorb the damage from the enemy. VEGA-5, Blackwood engineers made the power shield portable. Capture him! Grab the shield! I guarantee you'll find it useful. Turrets on twelve do not attack!<br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_voshod_5.jpg"><br><br>



	We have nothing to destroy them with. When you get close to the turrets, just get out of the line of fire. RPG! The shield can't take a direct hit! Its electronics are malfunctioning from the explosions. The enemy pulls together forces to protect the generator! Keep moving!<br><br>



	Here's the generator. Remove the lock. I will give him such a load, after which the industrial mining of cryptocurrencies will seem like school arithmetic. A capsule with an SED on the battlefield! I repeat: the SED capsule is on the battlefield! Damn SED! Don't go near him! Concentrate the fire! Knock them down!<br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_voshod_6.jpg"><br><br>



	Finish off in hand-to-hand combat! One of the four fuses is destroyed. Three left. Hold on! SED will stop hacking the generator as soon as he's done with you.<br><br>



	The last fuse is left!



	<h4>Passing stage 3</h4>



	This is Blackwood Ronin-1. The shield fell. I repeat: the shield has fallen. The enemy fleet enters the firing position. The estimated time to start the main phase of the battle is 6 minutes. Air defense forces prepare to repel airstrikes.<br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_voshod_7.jpg"><br><br>



	Priority: protection of the Atom object. The rest of the troops must act according to the Pacific protocol! The shield is removed. The task is done. Pick up Agent Nodu and move to the evacuation point.<br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_voshod_8.jpg"><br><br>



	It's started! Euroalliance has entered the fray. As soon as Noda gets on board the ship, we'll hit the nuclear power plant. It's so bad that the cows on my ranch are going to calve early.



	<h4>Passing stage 4</h4>



	Working for Blackwood has its advantages. The Blackwood UAV cameras are at your disposal. Operate silently. Kill quietly.<br><br>



	Attention! Blackwood sprays toxic gas. Avoid the poison cloud if nausea, vomiting, and death are not part of your plans for the evening. Blackwood's network security just sucks. Access to the database was obtained. I'm starting the download.<br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_voshod_9.jpg"><br><br>



	Capsule launch detected! Shoot them down in the air! More capsules! Don't let them fly! You won't like the content! The next launch! Of course, I'm interested in what's inside, but it's better to shoot them down in the air. Blackwood's data is decrypted.<br><br>



	I have two pieces of news. First , the Martian colonists are still alive. The second – we will save them with the help of the enemy's SED. Our evacuation is canceled. I repeat: the evacuation is canceled. The facility's doors are open! Welcome to the personal forge of Oberon White.<br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_voshod_10.jpg"><br><br>



	This is career hara-kiri, Corporal! If the whole operation goes wrong because of you, you'll be court - martialed. General! If the operation fails, Blackwood will court-martial me. More interesting than yours. End of line.<br><br>


	Blackwood has lost access to the surveillance system. Don't thank me. Kill silently and disappear.


	<h4>Passing stage 5</h4>


	The door is locked. Throws an error when trying to open it remotely. I'm sending the access code. Enter it in the security console. Excellent. The door is open. Oh, that Blackwood… They attack Mars, and the doors themselves are buggy. It's a pleasure to watch you. You're the best soldiers I've ever seen.<br><br>


	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_voshod_11.jpg"><br><br>


	Oberon plays big-SED is everywhere. The whole island is crawling with them. They're in capsules going to Mars. But the production of SED without sadrium is meaningless. I've been wondering why Oberon would risk everything for these robots. Today, after decoding the data, the puzzle is assembled.<br><br>


	You'll be surprised, I promise. Attention! The experimental SED is activated.<br><br>


	Arrange a crash test for him and send the freak for revision! You are something, VEGA-5! As soon as we're done here, I'll have iced drinks and hot hugs. The moment of truth. You'll be surprised, as I promised. In the room in front of you is the technology that will change the face of war forever.<br><br>


	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_voshod_12.jpg"><br><br>


	EDMS are managed by operators! I repeat: SED (pause) is controlled by (pause) operators! Killing the operator disables the SED.
