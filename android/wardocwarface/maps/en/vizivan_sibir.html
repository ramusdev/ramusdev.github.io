Events on the map Siberia to Survival mode is a enemy base which is in Siberia. In the area of the alleged fighting will be a forest, a frozen lake and building a base with radar.<br><br>

The landscape favors the use of a variety of tactical schemes. Open space will allow snipers to control the territory and in the forest area will have to work for a short distance. In the scheme of intelligence can see what the options are moving and loadout according to the situation.<br><br>

In addition to the new buildings of the radar station on the territory there are ruins of an old fortress. Some of them occupied by the enemy. LZ is also of the encampment of armored vehicles. You can use the trucks as cover.<br><br>

Not rely on someone — around only enemies who are so eager to tear you a badge as a trophy. The main task — to survive.<br><br>
