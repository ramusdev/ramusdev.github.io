The game has an updated map "Bridges", redesigned thanks to the efforts of the players of the "Atlas of War".<br><br>


The appearance of the map is significantly improved, the environment looks more modern, while the main objects remain in the same places, and the participants of the match will still be able to easily navigate the terrain.<br><br>


When creating the map, the wishes of experienced cyber athletes were taken into account, aimed at the tactical component. For example, by adding a new object, the "shot" on the stairs was removed, which, according to the players, gave a significant advantage to one of the teams.<br><br>
