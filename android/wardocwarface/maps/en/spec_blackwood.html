You are in the hands of Blackwood. Oberon White offers a new look. What if you've been fighting on the wrong side all this time?



<h4>Introduction</h4>



The soldiers of Blaskwood captured the sabotage squad "Vega-5" and agent Nodu, who managed to prevent the extermination of the colonists on Mars. The Euroalliance troops cannot come to the rescue and are forced to retreat.<br><br>

<h4>Plot</h4>



The success of the mission on Mars turned into a failure — your WEGA-5 squad was captured by Blaskwood operatives right in the seats of the SED operators. Oberon white was personally in charge of the operation. It seems that not only did General Lee Wharton not try to save you, but he opened fire on Oberon's Mantis, knowing that you were on board.<br><br>

After a long and painful torture, your will was broken. The final chord was a video where, on Wharton's orders, Agent Nodu is executed for insubordination. <br><br>

The world you knew is crumbling before your eyes. <br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_blackwood_4.jpg"></a><br><br>



Who is the real villain? It seems that Warface and Blackwood are both sides of the same coin. Oberon offers you two options: rot alive in dark cells or join the Omega Black squad. It seems that the choice is obvious!<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_blackwood_5.jpg"></a><br><br>



WEGA-5 squad survived! The fighters were held captive by Blackwood for more than a year. They were the first to pass the "Death Rooms". Based on them, it is formed... Omega Black squad.<br><br>



Warface Hunters from... Warface.<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_blackwood_6.jpg"></a><br><br>



You will take part in the battles on the side of Blackwood. As part of the Omega Black squad, assembled from captured and deceived WEGA-5 fighters, you will find yourself on the other side

side with the barricades and play an important role in the plans of Oberon White.<br><br>





<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_blackwood_7.jpg"></a><br><br>



You will have to act quickly and decisively in an environment where it is not known who is right and who can be trusted — and the plot will present many unexpected twists. <br><br>



It will force you to look at the confrontation between Warface and Blackwood in a new way.<br><br>



<h4>Gameplay</h4>



"Operation Blackwood" is a synthesis of new mechanics and the most successful gameplay solutions of past special operations. <br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_blackwood_8.jpg"></a><br><br>



There will be everything — and bosses with unique features, and a large open location for exploration, and the division of roles with team interaction, as well as" meat " gameplay and much more. <br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_blackwood_9.jpg"></a><br><br>



You decide where to go, and you can explore the vast territory of the island as you want.<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_blackwood_10.jpg"></a><br><br>



Each base is a game cycle, conditionally consisting of the capture of the building and the battle against the boss with the accompanying protection of the terminal. There are three such cycles in total.

Once in the landing zone, you decide in what order you will pass the bases and laboratories with the bosses under it. <br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_blackwood_11.jpg"></a><br><br>



However, remember — each next cycle will be more difficult than the previous one!<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_blackwood_12.jpg"></a><br><br>



An important role in the defense of the terminal will be played by auxiliary special equipment, which is purchased for Resources earned during the mission. For example, excellent

an assistant will be a portable protective turret — you can place it in a favorable firing position<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_blackwood_13.jpg"></a><br><br>



<h4>Underground locations</h4>



When fighting with the boss, your team will have to split up and perform fundamentally different tasks that will affect the overall result.<br><br>

Your comrades must enter the laboratories located under the bases, each of which is made in a unique style.<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_blackwood_14.jpg"></a><br><br>



<h4>Terminal</h4>



When completing the main task, a scale indicator will appear with the strength of the Warface terminal, which will need to be protected.<br><br>

However, remember — this is a complex device and you will not be able to repair it more than once.<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_blackwood_15.jpg"></a><br><br>



<h4>Resources</h4>



Resources will be required to activate the SED control chairs, repair the terminal, and build fortifications. <br><br>

You can get them both by killing enemies, and by opening special boxes that will appear between waves of enemy attacks.<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_blackwood_16.jpg"></a><br><br>

<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_blackwood_17.jpg"></a><br><br>



<h4>Drone</h4>

Another result of experiments with "dark energy" is a heavy security drone. It has several types of weapons and an energy shield.<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_blackwood_23.jpg"></a><br><br>



<b>Battle tactics</b>

After disabling the shield with a grenade launcher shot, the Drone has to expose its power source, which is vulnerable to the Arcus rifle. Grenade launchers can be obtained from the boxes, which will appear and disappear with a certain frequency. The crates are also used as a temporary shelter.<br><br>



<h4>Argus Reactor</h4>

A prototype of a gigantic reactor powered by "dark energy". It is protected by a special laser system connected to it.<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_blackwood_24.jpg"></a><br><br>



<b>Battle tactics</b><br><br>



To destroy the Argus, you will need to disable its most important elements. This will be prevented by enemy soldiers and laser emitters rotating around the reactor, which can be temporarily disabled by firing at them.<br><br>



<h4>Quantum</h4>

An experimental SED model that can instantly move over short distances, especially when taking damage or approaching an enemy.<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_blackwood_25.jpg"></a><br><br>



<b>Battle tactics</b><br><br>



The Quantum has an energy shield that can be disabled by Arcus rifle shots. If this happens, the boss will be immobilized for a few seconds. At this point, you need to get around him from the back and perform a special finishing to deal damage. <br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_blackwood_18.jpg"></a><br><br>



To destroy the Quantum, you will need to repeat this action several times.



<h4>Oborna and special targets</h4>

To fight the boss, your team will need to split into two squads — one will take the seats (there are only 3 of them), and the other will remain at the base and will guard the terminal with his comrades in the chairs.<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_blackwood_19.jpg"></a><br><br>



In the ranks of the enemy will be not only infantry, but also special equipment-including armored personnel carriers and helicopters.<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_blackwood_20.jpg"></a><br><br>



Defenders will be able to erect barricades, use portable turrets, laser barriers and other means of defense. And you can also order the delivery of grenade launchers to turn enemy equipment into a pile of scrap metal!<br><br>



To fight back, you will need all your skills and experience of teamwork!

	<h4>Reward</h4>



	The new special operation will continue the tradition of a cyclical system of awards, which works on the principle of cut-offs. They in Blackwood will not be the number of waves passed, as in "Hydra", but the bosses that must be defeated in different sequences.<br><br>



	In total, you can get up to three reward boxes per cycle. The content drops out randomly.<br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_blackwood_21.jpg"></a><br><br>



	You are guaranteed to get one of the boosters for 1 hour and one type of cards for crafting weapons of the Blackwood series in the amount of from

	50 to 1000 pieces. <br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_blackwood_22.jpg"></a><br><br>



	This is a powerful main weapon for all game classes, which will be a useful and pleasant addition to the collection of any fighter.

	To get the maximum reward (three boxes), "Operation Blackwood" must be completed with three different endings. <br><br>



	This means that in the final stage of the mission, you need to fight all possible bosses-Quantum, Argus and Drone. At the same time, the order of the sectors passed before the final battle will not affect the result.<br><br>



	If you complete a special operation with one or two different endings, you will receive one or two reward boxes, respectively. We will also describe the third case: You have completed the mission three times, but at the end you have fought Quantum twice and Argus only once. <br><br>



	In this case, you will get two boxes, because you have opened only two variants of the ending.<br><br>



	Thus, you will be able to decide for yourself how many rewards you want to get, and try different story options in the new special operation.<br><br>



	<b>The rewards for completing the mission include:</b>

	<ul>

		<li>Warbucks: 10500</li>
