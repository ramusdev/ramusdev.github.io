<h2>Exclusion zone</h2>

<div class="box-location">

	<div class="tth">Map name: <span class="tth_number">Exclusion zone</span></div>

  	<div class="tth">Game mode: <span class="tth_number">Battle Royale</span></div>

	<div class="tth">Location: <span class= "tth_number">Pripyat</span></div>

</div>



Events on the map "Exclusion Zone" occur immediately after the events of the special operation "Pripyat". The remnants of the Warface and Blackwood forces were under the deadly threat of radiation. <br><br>



In attempts to simply survive, the principle of "every man for himself" begins to work. Which is better-to hide in one of the destroyed houses or try to get to the downed "Mantis" in search of a secret weapon? Decide for yourself.<br><br>



You will have only 6 minutes to remain the only survivor in the "Exclusion Zone". <br><br>
