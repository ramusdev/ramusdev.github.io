Map " District #4 "for the" Team Battle " mode, which is set in one of the most atmospheric abandoned cities on the planet. The clash between the forces of Blackwood and Warface will take place in one of the districts of the abandoned city of Pripyat.<br><br>



Fighters who decide to desert from the battlefield will inevitably die from radiation.<br><br>



The general approach to the tactics of the battle on the map is standard for the "Team Battle" mode. The task of the players is to destroy the enemy soldiers. The winner is the team that has reached the limit of 150 kills or scored the most of them in the allotted time.<br><br>
