Pagoda is a game map of the Meat Grinder PvP mode. Events take place on one of the islands in the Pacific Ocean, similar to the one that you can visit during the passage of the special operation "Sunrise".<br><br>



Stormtroopers are best positioned at the sanctuary and in the spacious courtyard of the waterfall house, engineers and medics will be able to dominate inside the buildings and narrow courtyards, and snipers should take up positions at the edges of the map, which offers a great view of the battlefield.<br><br>



One of the features of the "Pagoda" is a water channel that crosses the entire map. In it, you can hide from the enemy in case of pursuit, reload your weapons and ambush them.<br><br>



"Pagoda" perfectly combines the atmospheric visual component and "meat" gameplay. Players will certainly be able to implement their favorite style of play on the map and get the most out of it. <br><br>
