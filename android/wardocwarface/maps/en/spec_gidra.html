Warface is waiting for a test of strength. Show everything you can do. Repel Blackwood's attacks and hold energy weapons at all costs.



<h4>Introduction</h4>



The soldiers of Blaskwood captured the sabotage squad "Vega-5" and agent Nodu, who managed to prevent the extermination of the colonists on Mars. The Euroalliance troops cannot come to the rescue and are forced to retreat.



<h4>Locations</h4>



The reason is the heavy fire, which started in the mobile sea base Blaсkwood under the name "Hydra".<br><br>

General Lee Wharton decides to send another detachment to Hydra-Sigma-3-to capture the Blackwood gun. This will prevent Oberon White from leaving the island with the prisoners, and the Euroalliance will be able to resume the offensive. <br><br>

The Sigma-3 fighters manage to get to the base, but the entire Hydra personnel rises from the lower tiers and tries to destroy the Warface squad.<br><br>

Great, the guns are ours! Let's check them out! It seems that on Tuesday those helicopters evacuating Blackwood from the island are smiling and waving at us.We're going to wave back at them!<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_gidra_5.jpg"></a><br><br>



That's what I mean by a shot! These guns don't kill — they wash off the face of the Earth. The enemy will want to regain control of the weapon by disabling the terminal. This is a complex device and it will not be possible to repair it more than once. Protect the terminal at all costs! <br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_gidra_6.jpg"></a><br><br>



We were just about to land on a freaking ghost ship! Until Oberon came up with the SEDs, he was betting on zombie soldiers. In the prisons of this vessel are the remains of this... a startup.<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_gidra_7.jpg"></a><br><br>



The enemy raises one of the parts of the platform. The battlefield is getting bigger. Adapt. Sigma Three. 82% of the base is open underwater. I'm sure there are hundreds of Blackwood soldiers and other evil spirits inside. Too bad we can't blow it all up yet. There would be a fish buffet.<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_gidra_8.jpg"></a><br><br>



Enemy infantry with jetpacks spotted! From now on, be careful and look up! Zombie kamikaze is brilliant! It's easy to make something die that's already dead. To arms, Sigma Three! Don't let me near the terminal!<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_gidra_9.jpg"></a><br><br>



The second part of the platform has started moving! Look for PG and resource boxes. Take everything that is not lying well. We need it more. As long as we control the gun, we control the entire sector. Reinforcements will be arriving soon. Your task is to live up to this moment.<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_gidra_10.jpg"></a><br><br>



Your colleagues from WEGA-5 are on the island in the captivity of Oberon. We will launch a rescue operation as soon as our troops land on the island. It is important to evacuate not only WEGA-5, but also agent Nodu. She will face an internal investigation for disobeying direct orders and insubordination.<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_gidra_11.jpg"></a><br><br>



It's getting more interesting. I'm fixing the lifting of the third part of the platform! Oberon is trapped. He understands that as long as we have the gun — he can't leave the island. When our strike group is on the island, we will capture it ... and finish it.<br><br>



Sigma Three! A ship with our troops has entered the sector! We'll be helping you soon! Cheer up! Everything around you wants you dead. It's like going back to school.<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_gidra_13.jpg"></a><br><br>



Blackout! Find a way to get the power back on immediately! You won't last long here without security systems. Hold on well. Sigma Three! Remember-Warface soldiers are not allowed to die without their commander's permission!<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_gidra_14.jpg"></a><br><br>



Blackwood is serious about regaining control of the gun. An entire army is rising from the lower tiers of the base! Get on the defensive! Enemy helicopter! Flew over the surface of the water, in the blind spot. Our guns can't shoot from that distance. Find the missiles and shoot down the reptile!<br><br>



You will not leave the platform until the operations in the sector are over. Do what you want, but the weapon must remain ours. In your old age, you will have something to remember, if there is anything. Hang In There, Three Sigma! There's not much left.<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_gidra_15.jpg"></a><br><br>



New enemy forces have moved out of the island, and the evacuation of Blackwood's forces continues. I can see the air transport, but Oberon's Mantis is missing.<br><br>



The ship with the help is already on the horizon, but the connection can not be established. Don't panic, the digital ID matches. These are definitely our guys. Our ship has arrived and ... It's pointing right at us! Damn it! This is the Blackwood cruiser! <br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_gidra_16.jpg"></a><br><br>



I repeat: Cruiser Blackwood! The "Friend-Foe" system has been hacked by the enemy! Immediately lower the platform guns under the water, they will not withstand a direct hit! All to the outer ring! Run!" The submarine will not help, the only hope is for you! <br><br>



The enemy vessel is equipped with a means of active destruction and suppression of torpedoes. Destroy the guns of the cruiser! Hit the ship's artillery! As soon as you destroy them , we will raise the cannon and wipe this bastard into the dust!<br><br>



<h4>Terminal</h4>

In "Hydra", players will defend a special terminal in the center of the map from opponents, each wave of which becomes more dangerous than the previous one. The enemy will want to regain control of the weapon by disabling it.<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_gidra_17.jpg"></a><br><br>



When completing the main task, a scale indicator will appear with the strength of the Blackwood terminal, which will need to be protected. The indicator is located above the player's health and armor scale. Use resources to fix the terminal, if necessary. <br><br>



However, remember — this is a complex device and you will not be able to repair it more than once.



<h4>Resources</h4>

Throughout the entire special operation, you will be able to receive Arenacoins. Resources for destroyed waves of enemies, for special combat successes, and from special chests.<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_gidra_12.jpg"></a><br><br>



Using the earned resources, you will be able to purchase grenade launchers, defensive turrets, laser and ballistic shields, which will significantly simplify the defense of the terminal and the destruction of the enemy.



<h4>Random events</h4>

On the map, events such as a power outage of auxiliary vehicles, an increase in the number of attackers, as well as the use of force barriers, poison gas, or smoke screens by the enemy can occur.<br><br>



This means that you will not be able to use the same tactics and will have to adapt on the go!
