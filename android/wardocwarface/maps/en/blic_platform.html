	The "Platform" map for the "Blitz" mode is an oil-producing two-story oil-producing platform located in the Atlantic Ocean off the southern coast of Argentina. When developing the "Platform", all the past experience of creating PvP maps was taken into account.<br><br>



	The level is made in contrasting red and black industrial colors — so it is easier to distinguish between opponents. The design of the map is made extremely simple, so that players can get used to it in 2-3 matches.<br><br>



	The task of the attacking team is to prevent the explosion of a charge already laid on the territory of the complex.<br><br>



	The task of the defenders is to protect the explosives from encroachments by eliminating the enemy team.<br><br>
