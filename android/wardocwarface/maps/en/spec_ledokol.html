Straight to the point, men. The situation is critical. Blackwood started against us this war. And while we're losing.<br><br> 

The enemy is attacking on all fronts. This is an operation of scale Channel: we strike with the support from sea and air. You should urgently intervene. <b>Manager</b>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

The situation is extremely serious. The game is over. This time the enemy is not just to win the battle: Blackwood plans to destroy us by the roots, destroyed the base of Warface. The loss of staff for the us equivalent of death, so do not move.<br><br>

Your team will land on adjacent to the base site, to inflict blows on the flanks. Strong support don't wait: all the main forces will be involved in the protection database. There are not only weapons but also almost all command of Warface, including General Lee Wharton.<br><br>

The enemy uses experimental weapons, upgraded attack helicopters and heavily armed cruisers.<br><br>

Also, we oppose the assault troops, consisting of the known enemies and absolutely original equipped opponents. A full-scale military operation designed to wipe us off the face of the earth.<br><br>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbQ0y4jFgN4"><img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_ledokol3.jpg"></a><br><br>

You will need to act in several stages. We do not expect that the attack can be reflected in a single blow, the enemy has in stock probably a lot of dangerous surprises. br><br>

Be constantly on the alert and looked at the sky overhead — there is reason to believe that today appear not only the sea birds and helicopters.

<h4>Passing step 1</h4>

Enemy forces are approaching our base, attack them from the flanks of the rocket launchers with guided missiles. Need to bring down as many enemies as possible, focus fire on the helicopters. br><br>

To get them, place missiles on target in flight — they will follow the crosshairs, otherwise they go by. And these missiles is a good thing, right?<br><br>

<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_ledokol4.jpg"><br><br>

The missile cruiser is preparing to attack, take cover! Forget the cruiser, we have a new problem. Blackwood captured the missile silos, missiles preparing to launch. Trek through the forest and enter into the mines. Missiles launched, Blackwood block all the roads, so it will be hot.<br><br>

The damn cruiser keeps mine under heavy fire. Ship launched capsules with turrets that are vulnerable in flight. Knock them in the air as fast as possible before they landed. It seems that with the turrets gone, they are no longer a threat. Now it's time to deal with this cruiser. Grab the rocket launchers and destroy K017 rocket-propelled missiles, and then get out of there.

<h4>Passing step 2</h4>

So, the purpose of Blackwood... God... It's a ten-city! They will blame us and arrange a global crisis. We must take control of this missile silo. You know what's at stake.<br><br>

Cut down one of the hacked terminals, redirecting our missiles. In the lower part of the shaft there is another terminal, it is responsible for the minutes of the launch. Blackwood turned our security system against us, will have to destroy their turrets. <br><br>

They blocked all the passages, but forgot something — the ventilation shaft. Stop launching rockets, then rockets will again be under our control.<br><br>

<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_ledokol5.jpg"><br><br>

Millions of people owe you their lives, but it is unlikely they ever will. Well, Blackwood is no longer able to blame us for his monstrous crime. Attack Blackwood — revenge for our recent operation Black shark. <br><br>

We drove the enemy into a corner and he has nowhere to go, but this is just getting more dangerous. Now Blackwood will stop at nothing.

<h4>Passing step 3</h4>

We lost contact with the main base, go to radioboxer. Opponents did not miss, is mine. The whole sector has just turned into one big minefield. Blackwood was sent to the battle pilot a helicopter 3000 MG. br><br>

We have no information about his weapons, so be careful. You must shoot down the helicopter, before he made a mess.<br><br>

Another bird enemy in the sky, surmount it. Enter the bunker and reconnect with the main base. Fighters need your help. The rocket is no longer a threat, but we lost contact with another team.<br><br>

<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_ledokol6.jpg"><br><br>

The path is blocked by one of the powerful combat turrets, constructed on the model of the Juggernaut. Go around the "Mammoth" and destroy his power source. Go to the second mine and clarify the situation.

<h4>The Passage step 4</h4>

Attention, the situation has changed. You will have to launch this rocket himself. We will give the coordinates and launch codes on the closed channel. Enter them through the terminal. Our security system is still turned against us, destroy the "Porcupine".<br><br>

<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_ledokol6.jpg"><br><br>

You attempted a difficult task and tipped the scales in our favor! We use the new coordinates to aim missiles at enemy ships. I hope they all to the last go down.

<h4>Walkthrough step 5</h4>

Blackwood plays big. Aircraft the enemy is going to attack our missile mines. All prepare for battle! The ship Blackwood was again launched capsules with turrets. Better to shoot them down while they are in the air.<br><br>

The rocket is launched, get ready. Find grenade launchers with rocket-propelled missiles and destroy the rocket ship. Thanks to you, we threw troops Blackwood on several fronts. Go to the base. The entrance to the main base on the other side of this forest. The enemy knows about our approach, so expect an ambush.<br><br>

<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_ledokol7.jpg"><br><br>

They will pay for what you did to our base. It is time to take revenge on the fighters. But Blackwood still not giving up. Their ship entered the Harbor and approaching our database. Now the advantage is on our side. <br><br>

Use the hovercraft to reach the cruiser. So you make long-range weapon of the enemy useless. Now or never, men.

<h4>Walkthrough step 6</h4>

The cruiser is still dangerous, so don't expect an easy walk. Even if artillery fire you without touching, explosions can break the ice beneath your feet. Once you get to that cruiser, he will focus fire on you. Your main goal... Damn!.. A direct hit on the second boat!<br><br>

<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_ledokol8.jpg"><br><br>

Fire on the cannons! Find grenade launchers and stay away from the sectors of fire of ship artillery. As soon as the rocket runs out, move on and move to another ice floe. You need to destroy the three naval artillery and motor vehicle.<br><br>

The complex artillery systems of the warship failed, but the capsule with the turrets activated again, dispose of them in the air. The ship has received critical damage, multiple decks flooded, the purpose is defeated!
