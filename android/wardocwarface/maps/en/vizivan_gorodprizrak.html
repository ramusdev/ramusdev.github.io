Warface headquarters received information that despite the loss of the main tower with a seismic drill, Blackwood forces maintained a presence in the exclusion zone. Moreover, in a short time, three towers were erected, creating a powerful electromagnetic radiation around them. <br><br>

General Lee Wharton and the entire command staff came to the conclusion that the mysterious patrons of Blackwood are preparing to test a new weapon of mass destruction.

In order to eliminate the development of Blackwood, several detachments are sent to Pripyat. But only on the spot to the fighters of Warface comes the realization that they were test subjects in the terrible experiment of Blackwood. <br><br>

The area around the towers is surrounded by an energy field, and the units themselves fall under the influence of psychotronic weapons, which causes them to panic and start attacking each other.<br><br>

The location is divided into 3 zones, one of which is randomly selected before the game starts. Moving outside the zone limits the energy barrier, attempts to overcome which will end in the death of the character.

<h4>Gameplay and Features</h4>

In the center of each zone is an electromagnetic pulse tower. Its delayed activation by one of the players takes place using a special terminal, and after 120 seconds, a powerful electromagnetic pulse destroys all living things. <br><br>

To survive, the fighters need to take shelter in a building with a terminal or adjacent buildings.<br><br>

Points for enemies destroyed by the pulse are awarded to the player who activated the tower. However, after using the terminal and before activating the tower, any player can reconfigure the terminal to get frags themselves. <br><br>

To re-use the terminal, at least 1 minute must pass after the pulse.<br><br>

Every 200 seconds, Blackwood drones fly over the map, which can detect all players within a 50-meter radius and show their position on the mini-map. The drones themselves are also displayed on the map and can be destroyed.<br><br>

As an auxiliary means to fight the enemy, you can use the FCG-R3 K1 energy guns, which will be dropped from the air in containers every 150 seconds. If the weapon is not raised within a minute, it explodes.<br><br>

Also on the map there are various anomalous phenomena, most of which are dangerous for players. Some anomalies move along a certain trajectory, so it's better not to get in their way!<br><br>
