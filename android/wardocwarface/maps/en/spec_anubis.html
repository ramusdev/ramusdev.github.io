Attention! We are waiting for an important job. Blackwood'm going to start a massive offensive in North Africa. Preparation is in full swing, but while they're vulnerable. If we create a diversion, we can disrupt their plans. br><br>

Follow my instructions and then Blackwood will not be good <b>General Lee Wharton</b>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

 Disturbing news come to us from the African region. Warface raids into the enemy's camp were not lost — the enemy has evaluated the threat and is now going more thoroughly to gain a foothold on the continent. For this, Blackwood urgently here is building fortifications, military bases, technical and scientific enterprises.<br><br>

Challenge your team to go to the place of events and to do everything possible to prevent the enemy to carry out their dark plans.

<h4>Levels of difficulty</h4>

A special operation is available on three difficulty levels: "Easy", "Hard" and "Pros".<br><br>

 The scenario of events at all levels of the same, however, is quite different difficulty the passage of the RAID, mainly due to increasing damage, which you get by increasing the number of enemies, speed of reaction and shooting accuracy.

<br><br><img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_anubis2.jpg"><br><br>

 The first level of difficulty is the easiest. Access to it is opened already on the fifth rank. In fact, this is an evaluation mode, to pass which is not difficult even for an inexperienced squad. Think of it as a tour of the mission, just watch and remember the sequence of events.<br><br>

The level of "Difficult" is a slightly difficult mission, "Easily", but here the detachment of the newcomers are only just beginning to play may fail. Access the job offer also in fifth grade.

<br><br><img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_anubis6.jpg"><br><br>

 But the mission of the Pro challenges the strongest and most coordinated groups. To undergo a special operation at this level of complexity can not everyone. Access to "Pro" requires a 10th grade and the presence behind the passable "Anubis" on the level "Difficult".

<h4>Assignment I</h4>

Goal: to infiltrate the missile base and disable the command center, thereby to prevent a successful launch of ballistic missiles aimed at civilian objects.<br><br>

 The helicopter takes you to the entrance to mountain research and production complex, where they plan to launch. Get into the command center of the base Blackwood, and, passing from room to room and kamiva the enemy resistance, locate the server room. Make your way to the server and upload a virus into the control system of the complex. It is necessary that ballistic missile, barely taking off, self-destructed.

 Intelligence has confirmed our worst fears. Oberon is still alive. It was not in the helicopter that you shot down in China. It seems that now he's running the operation here. If you meet a motherfucker, you know what to do.<br><br>

 Then immediately leave the complex and go to the next object. Your path lies through the gorge. Attention! Watch your step: the path strewn with dozens of mines to blow up any of them with a couple of accurate shots. To attack the next goal head on is suicide. Luckily for us, you can get there through the caves, avoiding the main defense perimeter Blackwood. We pulled up in front of them as the devils of the woodwork. Go to the waterfalls, the entrance must be somewhere near. The cave will lead you directly to the submarine base.

<h4>Assignment II</h4>

 Goal: to infiltrate the naval base and sink the submarine, thereby to block the channel and delay the enemy units.<br><br>

 Passing through the waterfall, you will find yourself on the outskirts of the naval base Blackwood. Use the element of surprise and fight inside. Clean office space from enemies and get to the inner docks. Find the submarine Blackwood and blow it — it will set the charges on her body. Boom! This will not only weaken the enemy, but impede the passage of troops sent in your footsteps, and you will be able to significantly break away from his pursuers.

<br><br><img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_anubis4.jpg"><br><br>

 During the retreat after a successful operation in one of the rooms you will see our old friend, Oberon white. That's really really unexpected surprise. Following only known to him purpose, he will share with you a unique code. Use it on the terminal in the next room — so you can avoid death from suffocation by gas.<br><br>

We don't understand what's going on. Why is it?.. Protect servers, while loading data. Surely it's a ploy... some kind of virus...

<br><br><img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_anubis7.jpg"><br><br>

 Something doesn't add up. Oberon laid out for us. We know the location of the main base Blackwood. We know she's without protection. It's very strange... Go to the exit, repulsing the attacks of enemy soldiers. There is little space for landing — strip Parking lot! Kill all and go to the last item of the mission.

<h4>Set III</h4>

Objective: scout the area and find out what Oberon.<br><br>

 The legendary pyramid of Anubis — who would have thought that this is their home base, here is hidden the main mystery of the African Blackwood! The enemy keeps your air defenses ready to attack any threat in the air. We were knocked out! Now we have only one way out — to understand what's happening here. Any price fall in the pyramid. Stay where you are until we find the entrance, then like inside.

<br><br><img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_anubis5.jpg"><br><br>

 So that's what they're up to. This is another factory producing cyborgs like the one we destroyed in Europe. You will have to repeat. Well, we'll blow everything to hell! Before you main console. If we overload the power generators, the entire system will fail.<br><br>

Now, these eggs will not hatch. It's time to leave this place! The chopper is down! We are unable to send another. Expect an armored vehicle. Reflect all the attacks of cyberzombie before arrival of saving transport. Now you can leave this cursed place. Everyone inside, now!
