	Fighters, welcome to Chernobyl. <br><br>


	I'm old enough to remember the accident of ' 86, but today you will face not only radiation, but also old acquaintances from Blackwood. - <b>Lee Wharton</b>


	<h4>Introduction</h4>

	Despite several defeats, Blackwood does not stop the project to create super soldiers. In Pripyat, bunkers and a giant tower were erected, where, according to rumors, experiments on people are being conducted. <br><br>

	What is the true purpose of these objects and what new dangers await the soldiers of the Warface squad during the mission in unfriendly territory?<br><br>

	The mere mention of the Chernobyl disaster makes the imagination draw pictures of desolation and horror. Warface fighters will land on the territory of an abandoned city. Will you be able to solve the dark secrets of Pripyat?<br><br>


	Work together-you can't win alone!

	<h4>Passing stage 1</h4>


	There's some interference on the line. Be prepared for the fact that we may have problems with communication.<br><br>


	What are all these zombies doing here? What kind of crazy adventure is Blackwood up to this time? You'll have to figure it all out. Just look at these mushrooms, if you can call them that. I've never seen anything like it in my life. <br><br>


	Good news from our experts - these zombies are no longer dangerous. But there is also bad news. It almost certainly means that Oberon has something much, much worse in store for us.<br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_pripyat_2.jpg"><br><br>



	Attention, drones! Shoot them down before they hit the target.<br><br>



	This is where the danger zone begins. If the Geiger counter starts to go crazy - do not go further, otherwise no doctors will help. These damn zombies are guarded by a special unit of Blackwood, so do not expect an easy walk.<br><br>



	The enemy gathers forces at the pool. Perhaps this is the key link in the chain. This device is of great value. Grab it so our techies can take a look at it. <br><br>



	This green goo that you see here appeared in Chernobyl for a reason. So far, we know very little, but it seems to be radioactive and directly related to the activities of Blackwood.<br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_pripyat_4.jpg"><br><br>



	The bird returns to the base, but will return soon. Take your positions. Prepare for an aerial attack. You know what to do - the RPG is in the boxes next to you. Destroy the enemy! Blackwood throw their flying fortress "Mantis" into battle. <br><br>



	Apart from the name, we know almost nothing about it, but rest assured-it is packed with the latest weapons.


	<h4>Passing stage 2</h4>


	This is a real bunker. Blackwood clearly don't want us to see what's inside, so they'll fight like mad. These turrets are protected by a force field. Try disabling it for at least a few seconds with an RPG.<br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_pripyat_12.jpg"><br><br>



	Let's find out what's going on here. Connect to the terminals. Great, we've started getting the data. I will contact you when they are decrypted. We'll see... It's a step up from the dumb-ass zombies.<br><br>



	The new enemy is much more dangerous, it is almost impossible to destroy it. SED has one weak point. Knock it to the ground from a distance, and then quickly attack in close combat. Back up, fighters! First, attack it from afar. <br><br>



	Don't get too close. It will kill you in one blow. Keep shooting until he falls down. This thing can only be destroyed with cold weapons. Incredibly, you managed to destroy Sed! So, wait a minute!<br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_pripyat_13.jpg"><br><br>



	Is the connection working?" Excellent. You were on the verge of death, but the danger has not yet passed. Blackwood is preparing to meet you at the tower-and clearly not with a red carpet.<br><br>



	We've decoded the files from the lab: Blackwood calls the green goo " sadrium." We also know the name of cyborgs-SADs. This material is clearly an important part of the entire enemy operation.<br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_pripyat_14.jpg"><br><br>



	A huge amount of sedrium waste appears on the surface in the swamps. There is production on an industrial scale, which clearly pursues a specific goal. Blackwood is enough of this to easily poison the whole of Europe. <br><br>



	It looks like the drill somehow damaged the pipes. Soon the Sedrium will be pouring out of this well - and then you'd better not get too close. Even the fumes from it are deadly.<br><br>



	Apparently, this whole cedrium enters the tower. You'll have to take it by storm.<br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_pripyat_15.jpg"><br><br>



	If the size of this thing matches the strength of the earthquakes it will cause, we're in big trouble. Oh, shit. Look down behind the glass. Remember the tectonic weapons from the volcano? Yes, exactly. <br><br>



	Blackwood is using it again. If the well is sufficiently deep, we are waiting for the unimaginable destruction. We need to stop them right now. This is a priority.<br><br>



	The enemy has reinforcements. Use the terminal to turn on the elevator. Get in the elevator before the other squads arrive.



	<h4>Passing stage 3</h4>



	Our tech geeks have an idea that might work. If you change the amplitude of the seismic drill, it will blow up the entire building. You just need to get to the control panel.<br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_pripyat_10.jpg"><br><br>



	The elevator is blocked, so you can't go down. You can get out by air, but our turntables are hindered by the "Mantis". Hold your position, destroy all the Blackwood soldiers, and most importantly, blow up the Mantis . There won't be another chance.<br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_pripyat_11.jpg"><br><br>



	This is the point where I usually say "well done". Blackwood lost another tower, and we got important information. And most importantly-by a miracle we got out of this hell without losses.
