"Marsorubka", as the name suggests, this time the action will unfold on the Red Planet, among the buildings of the Martian colonists, which you could already visit during the passage of the special operation "Mars". The new location will surely not leave anyone indifferent!<br><br>

The map is replete with both long and tight sections, so you will feel comfortable with almost any style of play.<br><br>

The development team managed to find a compromise solution that allowed us to simultaneously achieve realism, recognition and picturesque landscapes of the Red Planet-without compromising the gameplay.<br><br>

On Mars, you will find not only unique landscapes, but also reduced gravity. Because of this, the sensation of moving will be unusual. The movements will be slower, and the jumps will be higher and further. This will allow you to not only get a new gaming experience, but also have a lot of fun!<br><br>

When creating a new map, the same Asian setting was used as in the special operation "Sunrise". However, due to the features of the PvP mode, the objects on the location were selected in such a way that there were no problems with the "readability" of the players on the ground.<br><br>

 In addition to a single style, "Pagoda" has hidden references to the new special operation. It is here that the house of a distant relative of one of the heroes of the plot is located — Noda, an operative of the Warface squad embedded in Blackwood.<br><br>

What is Mars without SADS? Only robots will be available on the "Mars Grinder", and they will look the same as in the special operation "Mars". The fighters will be armed with the ARCUS energy rifle, which has several fire modes: assault automatic and tactical semi-automatic. The ARCUS can operate without overcharging, as long as it does not overheat.<br><br>



Not without "Easter eggs"! When you find yourself in battle, we advise you to look around and check the angles.<br><br>
