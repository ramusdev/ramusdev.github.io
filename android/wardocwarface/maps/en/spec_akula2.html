We tracked big investment project in the Balkans under the code name "Black shark". It has a direct relationship to the skyscraper that you've had it. Want to go back to chasing Oberon all 20 floors, so blow up this hill right now. The look on his face when the pile of money will turn to dust. br><br>

The look on his face when the pile of money will turn to dust. <b>General Lee Wharton</b>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

 Rest time is over! "Operation Anubis" gave us evidence that Oberon white is alive and has not abandoned their plans. We resumed the search for him.<br><br>

Now intelligence reports that in Eastern Europe discovered tower under construction, the building is suspiciously reminiscent of "operation White shark". If this is the new headquarters of the enemy, we have a big problem. We must destroy the building as quickly as possible. There is reason to believe that the tower will be completed in the coming weeks, and then it will be activated the protection system. With her new "Shark" will be virtually invulnerable.<br><br>

 The main task of the team will be setting charges on each floor for subsequent blasting of the building. In addition, it is necessary to extract data from machines in the internal network of the enemy. Even in an unfinished property will find a lot of useful information for us.

<h4>Levels of difficulty</h4>

A special operation is available on three difficulty levels: "Easy", "Hard" and "Pros".<br><br>

 The scenario of events at all levels of the same, however, is quite different difficulty the passage of the RAID, mainly due to increasing damage, which you get by increasing the number of enemies, speed of reaction and shooting accuracy.

<br><br><img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_akula2.jpg"><br><br>

 The first level of difficulty is the easiest. Access to it is opened already on the fifth rank. In fact, this is an evaluation mode, to pass which is not difficult even for an inexperienced squad. Think of it as a tour of the mission, just watch and remember the sequence of events.<br><br>

The level of "Difficult" is a slightly difficult mission, "Easily", but here the detachment of the newcomers are only just beginning to play may fail. Access the job offer also in fifth grade.

 But the mission of the Pro challenges the strongest and most coordinated groups. To undergo a special operation at this level of complexity can not everyone. Access to "Pro" requires a 10th grade and the presence behind the passable "Anubis" on the level "Difficult".

<h4>Task</h4>

Objective: set charges on the supports to climb on the roof and leave the building.<br><br>

 Set the charges and then the damn shark will fold like a house of cards. We still don't know why Oberon decided to build a skyscraper in the middle of nowhere. Any information is helpful — including laptops and terminals. On the upper floors, something weird is going on, and from there reach some sounds.

 Connect to the terminal, there certainly have something of value. It seems that Oberon has no idea how to control these creatures. Remember the last operation? Scientists Blackwood screwed up the signal, so-called "super-soldiers" have turned into monsters and destroyed the base, and then the surrounding villages. Since then, nothing has changed.

 On one of the floors are prison cells, and recently there someone came in. Will have to stay. Can not be! This team is the Icy peak! They went missing about a year ago. Need to get them out. Surely they have something to tell us. Here to open doors will not work. There must be a generator supplying them with energy. Will have to clean up the floor and turn it off. These guys are the only one who managed to get into the Siberian bunker. We lost contact with them immediately after that. Unplug it, then we can get our guys.
