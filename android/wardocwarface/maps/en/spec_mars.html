	The Martian colony is in danger! Stop Blackwood and save the colonists.



	<h4>Introduction</h4>



    Blackwood received data on the bacteria found on Mars. Their DNA matches existing samples of the prehistoric bacterium Cedrus. Cedrus was brought to Earth by a meteor shower two billion years ago.<br>

    They were sleeping at a depth of before the accident at the Pacific nuclear power plant. <br><br>



    <img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_3.gif"></a><br><br>



    11 years ago, Sedrus waste products were discovered at the crash site, which have a powerful effect on the nervous system — an accelerated reaction, a low pain threshold. This substance was called Cedrium.<br><br>



    <img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_4.gif"></a><br><br>



    The Anubis project, an attempt to create a super-soldier with it, failed. The subjects under Cedrium were unmanageable. <br><br>

    

    <img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_5.gif"></a><br><br>



    Blackwood changed the approach — now the subject is under observation, and his Sedrium-enhanced nerve impulses are transmitted to SED. Attempts to re-obtain the bacteria led Blackwood to Chernobyl, also affected by the nuclear accident. <br><br>

    

    <img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_6.gif"></a><br><br>



    Sedrium supplies are running low, but the live Sedrus discovered by the colonists will allow Blackwood to expand its production on an unlimited scale.<br><br>

	A storm approaches the Martian base, and after a while the storm completely covers the colony. Oberon White uses the circumstances so successfully developed to capture the colonists ' base and in a few minutes the landing pods with SADS enter the atmosphere of Mars. <br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_7.jpg"></a><br><br>



	The Warface squad will have to thwart his plans by fighting Blackwood outside of Earth with the help of enemy androids.<br><br>



	The Alfa team was given the command to clear the colony perimeter, and the Delta team was assigned to destroy a rover convoy that was caught in a storm outside the base and sent an SOS signal.<br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_8.jpg"></a><br><br>



	It is necessary to save the rovers with the colonists hiding under the shields and escort them to the main building. But do not forget about caution - colleagues of agent Noda from Blackwood with the help of SADS from the Bravo group are trying to intercept the colonists ' equipment.<br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_9.jpg"></a><br><br>



	The Warface squad will have to take the fire on themselves to save the colonists from the heavy droid Antey-6, taken under the control of the enemy. Should stay away and shoot them in the head until this bucket of bolts is not a change of tactics. The droid can be destroyed by its own weapons-shoot at the missiles as soon as it releases them.<br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_10.jpg"></a><br><br>



	Under the control of Blackwood was also a machine for terraforming Mars, which destroyed the SADS controlled by the Warface fighters. Noda is urgently looking for backup SEDs to reconnect and return to Mars. You also need to find a new connection location that will be the least secure. <br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_11.jpg"></a><br><br>



	Fortunately, there are several of them, among which there is even a completely empty room. Remember that you are on the territory of the enemy — sometimes you will have to go roundabout ways. Not always safe.<br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_12.jpg"></a><br><br>



	An unexpected news has just become known: from the specially resistant captured Warface fighters, a squad of hunters for Warface — Omega Black was formed. Unfortunately, our squad is in the middle of a tornado-the Euroalliance fleet continues to bombard the Pacific island. <br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_13.jpg"></a><br><br>



	Soon, Blackwood breaks through the cordon of the Euroalliance and begins to evacuate employees.<br><br>



	Happy news: The node has launched the protocol for activating the backup connection room, and when it reaches the end of the hall, it will be possible to enter it. Shoot all the SADS that come along the way from everything that is, and then open them by hand, like tin cans. <br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_14.jpg"></a><br><br>



	And if there are no surprises in the room, sit in the chairs and Noda will throw you back to Mars to put an end to this story.<br><br>



	Unfortunately, all that remains of the personnel of the Oasis-4 colony are the rovers with the colonists. Inside the main body there is a remote control for manual control of the transport ship. This is the only chance to evacuate the survivors.<br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_15.jpg"></a><br><br>



	Blackwood has not been able to obtain live Cedrus, and the Earth's supply of Cedrium is coming to an end. Without the Martian bacteria, their plans for the Sads are doomed. Noda gained access to the plans for the colonization of Mars. In the center of the colony there is a mine with a missile containing a nuclear charge! <br><br>



	The colonists wanted to conduct an experiment to terraform Mars, causing a nuclear strike on the south pole of the planet. Sometimes it seems that on this planet, even boxes tend to kill.<br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_16.jpg"></a><br><br>



	The arachnid mech is back on the radar. Oddly, he's not heading for the colonists... We need to upgrade our weapons urgently. You have to be prepared for whatever he's up to. There are five corridors. Each fighter goes to his own. One corridor, one person, one module. <br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_17.jpg"></a><br><br>



	When you come across the turrets under the power shields-shoot at the power supplies, and the shield will turn off. As soon as you find the module, install it on your weapon.<br><br>



	This spider loves spectacular appearances... behind the door is a rocket silo and an arachnid. Before that, there was rock and roll. Heavy metal is about to start. Hold out until the Node will not get control of the rocket using the field Communicator. <br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_18.jpg"></a><br><br>



	She will be very grateful if you will make this creature get away so as not to interfere with the launch. Do not expose yourself to lasers. The lasers rotate counterclockwise and can cut the SED into pieces, so they are deadly. <br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_19.jpg"></a><br><br>



	It is necessary to shoot at the power modules of the lasers at a time when they open for cooling and become vulnerable. Blackwood SADs will try to interfere with Warface, but you should be careful — the enemy SADs look the same as ours. <br><br>



	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_20.jpg"></a><br><br>



	The spider is preparing an electromagnetic pulse that can disable our SEDS or interrupt the launch of the rocket. After inflicting critical damage on the arachnid and finishing it off, it is necessary to gain control of the warhead and turn this entire colony into radioactive ash.



	<h4>Opponents</h4>



	The rescue operation of the Warface VEGA-5 squad will be opposed by various Blackwood forces.<br><br> 

	To achieve their selfish goals for the production of sedrium, Blackwood landed on Mars capsules with SEDs designed for the unique conditions of the red planet. <br><br>



	The colonists ' equipment, including mining droids and a Mars terraforming machine, was hacked and targeted by their masters. <br><br>



	On the Ground, Blackwood also has a lot of "surprises": the best units of fighters, powerful combat turrets, the latest versions of SADS, as well as the latest developments of scientists — homing spider mines.<br><br>

	<h4>Spider Mines</h4>

	Homing explosive devices — agile and agile enemies that, when detected by the enemy, move in his direction and explode, reaching the target. Alone, they don't pose much of a threat, but you have to be careful — spiders don't like being alone.<br><br>

	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_34.png"></a><br><br>

	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_35.png"></a><br><br>



	<h4>SED-2</h4>

	Blackwood did not waste time and significantly improved their cybernetic SED soldiers, after which they became even more deadly. The new model SED-2 is now equipped with a grenade launcher, and can also throw grenades with a toxic effect, which makes it extremely dangerous.<br><br>

	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_38.png"></a><br><br>



	<h4>Arsonist</h4>

	A specially protected version of the SED-2 cyborgs, armed with a flamethrower. This enemy is able to set fire to the space around them, cutting off the escape routes. It will be advisable to keep a distance from him, but you will not be able to kill him without coming close.<br><br>

	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_50.jpg"></a><br><br>

	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_40.jpg"></a><br><br>



	<h4>Martian SED-2</h4>

	Blackwood's main offensive force on Mars. They are armed with energy weapons and have different roles on the battlefield-sniper or stormtrooper. The most dangerous elite SED-2, painted in black - they are designed for frontal attacks and have a large margin of safety.<br><br>

	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_45.png"></a><br><br>



	<h4>Antey-6</h4>

	The colonists ' heavy droid, which is designed for mining, is used as a combat vehicle in the hands of Blackwood, who have taken control of it. He fires a machine gun, and when he is in a vulnerable position, he launches homing missiles and uses a protective EMP field.<br><br>

	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_41.png"></a><br><br>

	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_42.png"></a><br><br>



	<h4>Terraformer-1</h4>

	The giant mechanical monster is the deadliest weapon Blackwood has ever seen. This boss is impossible to deal with in a direct collision. The correct solution is to study its behavior to identify vulnerabilities and disable Terraformer-1.<br><br>

	<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_43.png"></a><br><br>

	<h4>Locations</h4>



The Warface VEGA-5 squad will once again have to fight in unfamiliar enemy territory. Fortunately, the Warface fighters will be lucky enough to be behind enemy lines on neutral territory for both sides of the conflict — on Mars, which significantly increases the chances of turning the tide in their favor and successfully complete the task.<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_21.jpg"></a><br><br>



Throughout the mission, the enemy will not let you relax, trying to catch the right-wingers in their many traps, including the latest defense system-lasers. The enemy complex, located on the island, is teeming with mysterious nooks and crannies, so do not lose your guard!<br><br>



At one stage of the special operation, the enemy's fire will be so dense that protection will require shelter. But there is no time to lose, so you will have to use a large moving container and move forward.<br><br>



<h4>Mars</h4>

The first thing that distinguishes Mars from Earth is its gravity, which is lower than Earth's, so the sensation of moving will be quite unusual. The movements will be slower, and the jumps will be higher and longer.<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_22.png"></a><br><br>



By the way, it is spring on Mars, but you should not admire the local scenery for a long time, because the surface of Mars is fraught with many dangers. When exploring the expanses of Mars, it's best to stick together.<br><br>

<h4>Colonist base</h4>

The Martian colonists built the Oasis-4 research station, which is the target of the Martian invaders Blackwood, and the colonists in the rovers are all that remains of its personnel.<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_26.png"></a><br><br>



In the center of the Oasis-4 station there is a mine with a missile containing a nuclear charge. The colonists wanted to conduct an experiment to terraform Mars, causing a nuclear strike on the south pole of the planet.<br><br>

<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_29.png"></a><br><br>



<h4>Laser beams</h4>

Blackwood scientists have created a unique system of protection — powerful laser beams, through which it is impossible to pass, remaining alive. <br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_30.png"></a><br><br>



At some stages of the mission, the lasers will create deadly obstacles and turn off at certain intervals, while at others they will move along a given trajectory. Movement is the only key to success.<br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_31.png"></a><br><br>



<h4>Death Room</h4>

The corridor with ten compartments is the "Death Rooms" through which the captured Warface soldiers were forced to pass. The list of dead includes 225 people, which is 96 percent of the fighters. <br><br>



<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_mars_32.png"></a><br><br>



The remaining 4 percent is a squad that was shot down during Operation Black Shark and was held captive by Blackwood for more than a year. So far, they are the only ones who managed to survive.<br><br>
