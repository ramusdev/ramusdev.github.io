 Squad Warface found the country Villa of the enemy, which stores a transmitter and drawers with new weapons. The command has decided to undermine the dangerous goods, but this time the object came a detachment of Blackwood.<br><br>

 After decoding the data received during the assault on the Black shark, we were able to establish the location of the enemy receiver-transmitter. The vanguard Warface arrived on the scene, neutralized the guards and prepared equipment for evacuation, but in the district there were special forces of Blackwood. The command decided to blow up the object, and also boxes with new weapons that are close.<br><br>

 Fighting area is large enough: a lot of passes, descents in cellars and lifts to the upper floors, narrow circuitous routes and open spaces. The possibility of undermining the gates and doors will make the game unpredictable.<br><br>

 The main difference is the speed of events. You still need to defend or defuse the bomb, but it is given only 90 seconds! Object, next to which is explosive, only one, but the task does not become easier: the key point is many passages. In addition, the timer on the explosive device active at the very beginning of the battle, so think and we must act quickly. Will be able to lead your squad to victory? Very soon you will test their strength in battle on the new map, created specifically for this mode!<br><br>
