I said that we would meet again and — believe it or not — I'm a man of my word. The storm brought down all channels of communication. No one will come to help you. No one but me. You don't trust me, but I'm your only chance to survive the night. <b>Oberon white</b>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

Fighters Warface fall into a sand storm. Communication with headquarters is lost, around midnight, teeming with zombies. Can the squad get out of this difficult situation? It all depends on you!<br><br>

Warface squad will have to rally as never before. In the way of many enemies. Comes to the aid of an unexpected ally, who will help you to avoid the sad fate, but how clean his motives?<br><br>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ4f1ZyLJa4"><img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_zatmenie2.jpg"></a><br><br>

You will need to act in several stages. We do not expect that the attack can be reflected in a single blow, the enemy has in stock probably a lot of dangerous surprises. br><br>

Be constantly on the alert and looked at the sky overhead — there is reason to believe that today there will appear helicopters.

<h4>Tactic</h4>

Introduce you to review tactical diagrams of all stages of the operation "Eclipse", where you can find a lot of useful information on: the direction of motion, important points on the map and much more.

<h4>Enemies</h4>

<h4>Passing step 1</h4>

Expect an armored vehicle. Reflect all the attacks of cyberzombie before arrival of saving transport. Everyone inside, now! Hold on, men, don't let the zombies get to the car.<br><br>

Looks like some problems with the engine, protect the car. We need to buy time.

<h4>Passing step 2</h4>

The storm brought down all channels of communication. No one will come to your aid, except for Oberon — he is your only chance to survive the night. Nearby is the ancient ruins, there you will find shelter and supplies. br><br>

Just keep in mind — there is no beaten path, you have to pave it themselves. Even a small fire will not go unnoticed — soon Blackwood will be out on the trail.<br><br>

Oberon will guide you through the Outpost, but you must only do what he has to say. Can you believe, now it is in the common interest. Do not go into the darkness. Who knows what could be hiding in these Sands?<br><br>

This experiment with the zombies was quite... bad. But it was necessary. Progress always has its price. Now you need to forget about past mistakes and focus on the future. ... Get ready for the meeting. br><br>

<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_zatmenie3.jpg"><br><br>

While you can — relax. Well, now you are locked in the bunker. Have to destroy the system of protection to get out of it.<br><br>

Continue your path lies through the local village. Here are the coordinates. The roads are teeming with creatures that try to kill you. Stay close to the light. For their own benefit. Here your job is done, Warface. Follow on.

<h4>Passing step 3</h4>

In the nearby village is full of zombies. We advise you to be alert. Total chaos! This is what happens when you lose control of the situation. Ancient ruins already there. Stay close to the road — in the forest creatures even more.<br><br>

<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_zatmenie6.png"><br><br>

Congratulations, Warface — did you get to the ruins without much loss. Now I have to deal with what's inside. Locate the entrance to the underground base — this is a shelter that you now need. To cope with the latest task — you a free, no — die.<br><br>

This is one of the new, improved pet Oberon. Alas, this base can not produce them in the right quantity. So it will have to collapse.<br><br>

From here there are two exits. If you don't seal them, the zombies will attack again and again. Suggest to start from the West exit, after you seal the East exit. Next, go to the main terminal and unplug it to stop the production of zombies. br><br>

Finally! Can be considered mission accomplished. Nearby there is a corridor that leads you out into the canyon.

<h4>Passage step 4</h4>

Finally, the connection was restored. Blackwood was jamming our signal for many hours. Now you have to climb to the elevation, so that the chopper could pick up.<br><br>

<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_zatmenie7.png"><br><br>

Ahead military base Blackwood — we record an increased activity. Don't know what you did, but Oberon is clearly not going to you so just let it go. Nothing, we'll get you out — just get to the point of evacuation. We can pick you up until you deal with this turntable. Find an RPG and shoot it.<br><br>

We just found the perfect place to land near you has a helipad. Get to her as quickly as possible. It's crazy! They strike at their own base. There is a fallback next to the hangar — the chopper will sit there. Hurry while Oberon was not busted up all to hell.<br><br>

<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/maps/image/spec_zatmenie8.png"><br><br>

Attention! The enemy throws to battle new forces. God, these things are becoming uglier! Take cover — with this monster not to be trifled with. Work together. Focus fire on target when she's vulnerable. We have little time! Blackwood from minute to minute will erase everything here is in powder. br><br>

One last spurt fighters! Bins in Blackwood there are no more monsters. Get familiar with these, and the way home free.
