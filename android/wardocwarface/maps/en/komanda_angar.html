Updated map of the Hangar. It's the old Hangar, but processed it in accordance with the new standards of graphics and overall tried to make it even better!<br><br>

Abandoned industrial hangar is a great place to clarify the relationship between soldiers of Warface and Blackwood. The hangar - not very big, but a multi-tiered map with three levels. So here you can not only get lost in the aisles between the cargo containers, but can get shot from anywhere. And look at his feet - for every corner you can wait for a carefully installed mine.<br><br>
