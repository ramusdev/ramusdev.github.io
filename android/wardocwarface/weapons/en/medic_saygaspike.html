A modified version of the" Saiga " in the bullpup layout. The gun is manufactured by Center Balanced Systems. The weapon is equipped with heavy bullet cartridges, which allows you to deal high damage and knock down.



<h4>Combat Effectiveness</h4>



Saiga Spike is made in a very simple and concise design. The layout of the bull-pup has a positive effect on the accuracy of the weapon, and the Picatinny bars allow you to install all the modules available to medics. <br><br>



But the most interesting thing about this shotgun concerns its characteristics. The Saiga Spike is loaded with a bullet cartridge, not shot. The power of the shot is such that at a distance of up to 12 meters, it knocks over any opponent on his back, if you can not kill him with the first hit. <br><br>



The damage of 500 units and one bullet does not leave a chance for opponents at close and medium range, but at the same time, a small ammunition and a low rate of fire do not give the right to make a mistake.<br><br>
