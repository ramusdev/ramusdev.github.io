The SAP6 in Warface is a pump-action shotgun that uses magazines to speed up reloading. But it's not just the quick reload that makes this weapon different. The SAP6 has a spring-loaded handguard, which makes reloading easier.

He joined the legendary branch of suppliers.



<h4>Combat Effectiveness</h4>



Good rate of fire and high damage make the SAP6 one of the best pump-action shotguns in the game. Its main competitors are the MAG-7 and Fabarm STF 12 Compact, which are the closest in terms of firing rate, accuracy and magazine capacity.



<h4>Advantages</h4>

- High damage<br>

- Good shooting accuracy in aiming mode<br>

- Good rate of fire<br>

- Quick recharge



<h4>Disadvantages</h4>

- Poor shooting accuracy from the hip



<h4>Historical background</h4>

The SAP6 shotgun was developed by the Turkish company Dagger Arms in 2014. When creating it, the designers wanted to move away from the concept of classic pump-action guns, focusing on small size and convenience.<br><br>

The use of box magazines made it possible to achieve the goal — the length of the SAP6 barrel is 290 mm, as well as to achieve a high reloading speed. The telescopic butt has several positions, which also makes the shotgun more convenient.<br><br>



The SAP6 uses 12-gauge cartridges, the standard magazine is designed for 6 such cartridges. Manual reloading is carried out using a movable handguard, which does not have a limiter and its stroke is screwed in front of the muzzle.<br><br>


On the upper part of the receiver, almost the entire length of the Picatinny rail is located, which allows you to adapt the SAP6 to certain combat conditions.<br><br>
