  <h4>Historical background</h4>



The Sturmgewehr 44 is a German submachine gun developed in 1944 by Mauser Werke.<br><br>



From submachine guns (PPSh), which were massively used in the Second World War, it was distinguished by the ability to conduct aimed fire at a much longer range, primarily due to the use of the so-called intermediate cartridge, more powerful and with better ballistics than the pistol cartridges used in submachine guns.<br><br>

Among the machines of the modern type, it was the first development that was mass-produced. The total production of Sturmgewehr 44 for 1943-1945 was more than 400 thousand units, and in the post-war period its production was not resumed.<br><br>



However, the Sturmgewehr 44 submachine guns were used in limited numbers in the early post-war period in the GDR and Czechoslovakia, and in Yugoslavia they remained in service with the airborne forces until the 1970s.<br><br>
