  <h4>Historical background</h4>

The M1928 automatic submachine gun was developed in 1918 by John Thompson and belongs to a relatively small family of caliber submachine guns .45 ACP. This weapon was widely used first during the "Prohibition", and after-during the Second World War.<br><br>



 The Thompson submachine gun (or Tommy gun) has long been in service with the military, police, and FBI agents. Now this gun is often found in gangster movies.<br><br>



Despite the complexity of the design and expensive production, the weapon was distinguished by reliability and high quality of manufacture. The M1928 model is a modification of the first production model M1921. It has two fire modes, a finned barrel equipped with a muzzle compensator, and a reduced rate of fire. <br><br>



The weapon was produced with both a vertical front handle and a conventional wooden handguard.<br><br>
