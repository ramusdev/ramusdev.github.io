<h4>Historical note</h4>

M60E4 — a single machine gun, developed in the postwar years. The gun is made by American company "Saco Defense". For the shortcomings of the design and appearance was nicknamed "the pig".

Despite the fact that since the 1980-ies began the process of ousting the M60 more advanced machine guns such as the M240 Belgian design, this weapon is still produced and is widely used, though primarily on "the sidelines".<br><br>

From the point of view of the design basically consisted of a hybrid of the two systems of German engineering during the Second world war automatic rifle FG-42 machine gun MG 42. The design of the weapon was too light weight, the "shifting" his fighting qualities in the direction of the machine gun, not one.<br><br>

M60E4 is a fully automatic weapon, built under the scheme gas driven automatics and barrel locking rotating bolt. The original design allows the rod and the shock absorber to move when you roll back to the inside of the butt, which reduces the overall length of the gun. Large handguard convenient for carrying and folding bipod protect hands from burns.<br><br>

But this weapon was unsuccessful, for example, vapor-node vibration when shooting "samarasuriya" that forced the gunners to further twist his wire, and he also made improper Assembly. Slide group differed by a small margin. Worn weapons had a penchant for spontaneous shooting.<br><br>

The barrel mounted carrying handle is also used when replacing a hot barrel and front sight on higher ground. Replacing the stem is long and laborious.<br><br>

At the bottom of the receiver has a bracket for mounting a machine gun on an infantry machine tools or equipment. When used as a machine gun, the weapon is mounted on a tripod machine, which provides a greater degree of precision and guidance than fry.<br><br>

At the vapor block has a mount on which are mounted bipod or grip. The gun is equipped with a removable butt, which is made of high impact polymer.<br><br>

On top of the receiver is open sight. On the receiver machine gun mounted rail-type Picatinny rail, allowing to put any collimator and optical sights with corresponding mounts.<br><br>
