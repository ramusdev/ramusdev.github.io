German light machine gun developed by Heckler & Koch. MG36 was to replace the heavy machine gun H&K G36, but the project was stopped after the Bundeswehr has lost interest.<br><br>

Lightweight assault rifle developed for the US army in the early 2000-ies.

<h4>Purchase</h4>

H&K MG36 can be purchased in the game store ("Arms") for Warbucks after its opening from suppliers ("Normal").

<h4>Battle performance</h4>

The main advantage - a large store, kompensiruet low reload speed.<br><br>

The use of this weapons is prohibited at tournaments for Warface.

<h4>Advantages</h4>
- A spacious store<br>
- Low cost of purchase and repairs<br>

<h4>Disadvantages</h4>
- Low rate of fire<br>
- Low accuracy, which does not allow to conduct effective fire at long range<br>
- Low damage<br>
- Long cooldown<br>
- A small number of modules available for installation<br>
- Requires opening from suppliers<br>

<h4>Historical note</h4>

 After the unification in 1990 of East and West Germany needed to develop a new, not too expensive, but it's a good weapons system for the new country. In this regard, in 1992, the military leadership of Germany raised the question of the development of assault rifles and light machine guns unified with her. Soon the Heckler & Koch had submitted a fairly cheap family of weapons – MG50 machine gun and assault rifle НК50. <br><br>

 In 1996, they were accepted by the Bundeswehr under the designations H&K MG36 H&K G36, respectively, and began mass production of this complex of small arms. To speed up development was used to layout the experimental rifle НК36, which the firm created back in the late 1970's, USM from G3, and a modified scheme of automation from the American M16 assault rifle.<br><br>

One of the features of the assault rifle H&K G36 is the ability to quickly rework in installation MG36 heavy barrel and double-disc ("double drum") store C-MAG for 100 rounds. In both cases, the barrel length is the same. For parts of special purpose created the rifle G36K barrel length which is 318 millimeters.<br><br>

Many details of this family of weapons are not strict tolerances in production, which gives the opportunity to use a rifle in the heavy pollution and large dust. Also to reduce the cost and simplify the production in the construction of weapons (handguard, a box of percussion trigger mechanism, shops, butt) are widely used polymer materials of high impact glass-filled polyamide<br><br>

Metal parts of the rifle are covered with special insulating coating. It significantly reduced heat radiation weapons when firing, and, therefore, reducing the telltale signs, complicating thereby the enemy notch shooters at night imaging devices.<br><br>

Job automation is provided by the exhaust gases. A feature of the weapon was a side gas engine original design, made with the division leading mobile parts of control system – the bolt that is not dependent on the gas piston. <br><br>

The decision of the venting system allowed to create a relatively light weapon, reducing the weight of the locking node, and reducing the influence of moving parts on the stability of the weapon. The design of the weapon allows you to fire from the right and left shoulder.<br><br>

G36 assault rifle, firing bursts showed good accuracy from distance of 100 meters place, consisting of 5 shots, gives dispersion less than 12 inches. As MG36 heavy barrel of the same length as the rifle performance accuracy similar. The primary firing mode of the G36 – short bursts up to 5 shots; MG36 — continuous or queue up to 15 shots.
