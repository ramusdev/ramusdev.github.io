  < h4>Advantages</h4>

  - High damage<br>

  - High shooting accuracy<br>

  - High accuracy when shooting from the hip<br>

  - Unique modules



  <h4>Disadvantages</h4>

  - Missing<br>



  <h4>Historical background</h4>

In 2007, Magpul Industries engineers decided to redesign the design and appearance of the M16 series of weapons, using the best practices of the FN SCAR, XM8 and other modern weapons. In just four months, the new Magpul Masada ACWS (Adaptive Combat Weapon System) was created. <br><br>



In 2008, the rights to the ACWS system were acquired by Bushmaster Firearms, which made its own changes and sent it into mass production under the name Bushmaster ACR (English Adaptive Combat Rifle-adaptive combat rifle). In the early 2010s, the Remington Arms Company also began to produce these weapons.<br><br>



Most of the ACR parts are made of polyamide fibers, intertwined with each other and covered with a moisture-proof layer on top. The body of the weapon can withstand heat up to + 210 degrees Celsius and about the same frost. <br><br>



Modification CQB (from the English. Close Quarters Battle — melee) has a shortened barrel and forearm with additional guides. The reduced size is ideal for fighting in a limited space: small rooms, corridors, dense urban development.<br><br>
