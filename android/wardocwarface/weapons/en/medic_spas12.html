<h4>Purchase</h4>

Comes Warbucks forever.

<h4>Battle performance</h4>

Among pump action shotguns SPAS-12 possesses the best characteristics such as excellent damage and range, i.e. the chance to kill the first shot from his maximum.

However, all these advantages overlap one drawback - a terrible rate of fire. If you are using Remington 870 CB or Hawk Pump in the case of the survival of the enemy, the player has the chance to finish his second shot, when using SPAS-12 the chance usually does not happen.<br><br>

The principle of "One shot - one kill" works here as well, and bolt sniper rifles. That is why for a good game with the SPAS-12 in PvP you need to have a "good response, direct hands and nerves of steel", and also to correctly choose the moment for the shot.

<h4>Advantages</h4>
- Good damage<br>
- Good firing range<br>
- Two slots for modifications<br>
- Purchase price and repair small<br>
- Good accuracy when firing from the hip

<h4>Disadvantages</h4>
- Very low rate

<h4>Historical note</h4>
Shotgun SPAS-12 was developed in the 70-ies of XX century by the Italian company Luigi Franchi. For it was taken as the basis of a self-loading hunting gun Luigi Franchi PG 80. The production of the SPAS-12 began in 1979 and continues until now.<br><br>

The shotgun was initially positioned as a universal military weapons for police and military. Accurate opinion on the decoding of abbreviations SPAS there - it reads as either Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun (automatic shotgun sports), or as Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun (automatic shotgun special purpose).<br><br>

SPAS-12 is widespread in police and special forces and also used civilians for self-defense and participation in sports competitions. The gun is highly reliable, but has a rather large weight and complex structure. The shotgun usually comes with a metal folding stock and plastic pistol grip.<br><br>

Italian shotgun SPAS-12 can operate in two modes. The first mode used in "Warface" – manually reload with a movable forearm that is connected to the gas piston, the so-called "pump system" (Pump Action). The second mode of weapon – semi-automatic.<br><br>

The automatic shotgun works through the use of the energy of powder gases that are excreted through the hole in the barrel and acting on the gas piston, which is connected to the slide frame with two pushers.<br><br>

Thanks to semi-automatic mode Terminator in the film fired at police from a SPAS-12 with one hand. Of course, this could only be done with either a very strong person, or a cyborg.
