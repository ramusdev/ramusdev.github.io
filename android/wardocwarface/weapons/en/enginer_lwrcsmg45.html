	The SMG-45 is a modern submachine gun from the American company LWRC. It was introduced to the public in 2016. This is a representative of the currently small family of caliber submachine guns .45 ASR, such as the well-known H&K UMP.<br><br>

	The comparison with the latter is not accidental, because the SMG-45 was created largely as a UMP response to the American market and can even use stores from it.<br><br>



	The creators paid great attention to the ergonomics of the weapon, providing it with two-way controls: a symmetrical fire mode switch, a magazine lock and a shutter stop. And the front handle can be used by both left-handed and right-handed alike.<br><br>



	Thanks to the special patented upper part, where the moving mechanism is located, the LWRC SMG-45 can be fired with the butt folded. In this case, the butt does not overlap the extractor for the sleeves. Caliber cartridge.45 ASR has a high stopping and striking ability, which makes the LWRC SMG-45 a formidable weapon.<br><br>
