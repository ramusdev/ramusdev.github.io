<h4>Historical note</h4>
Sniper rifle SIG SG 550 was designed for the army special forces. The basis was taken a reliable automatic rifle StG 90.<br><br>

However, it soon became clear that a sniper rifle chambered for 5.56 mm in combat, losing much of the characteristics of arms of the Soviet sample made chambered for 7,62x54r, so NATO forces were forced to abandon this development.<br><br>

So rifle armed police units, as ideally suited for use in the city.<br><br>

The SIG 550 has a folding stock with a hard butt pad, adjustable in length and height. The length and the comb of the stock is adjusted by two wheels. This can be done without lifting your butt from the shoulder, which significantly reduces the time required for the adjustment of the weapons under specific arrow.<br><br>

To fire from rifles can both right-handed and left-handed. Food SIG 550 is from detachable double-row of shops with a capacity of 5, 20 and 30 rounds. On the downside, the rifle can be attributed to the inability to install night sights, and a lot of weight — about 7 pounds without ammunition.<br><br>

However, the rifle remains in service with the police of Switzerland and several other countries, showing excellent results.
