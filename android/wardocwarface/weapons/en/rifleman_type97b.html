<h4>Advantages</h4>

- Excellent damage<br>

- Good rate of fire<br>

- Easily controlled recoil<br>

- High penetration capacity



<h4>Disadvantages</h4>

- Low accuracy when shooting from the hip<br>

- Low range<br>

- Two module modification slots



<h4>Historical background</h4>



Type 97B-a variant with a shortened barrel, designed for special units and the Chinese Navy. The design of the flame extinguisher is changed, so shooting rifle grenades is impossible, as well as installing a bayonet or a grenade launcher under the barrel.<br><br>



Type 97 - In the 80s of the XX century in the defense industry there was a tendency to reduce the caliber of firearms. This made it possible to reduce the recoil and increase the accuracy of shooting with small losses in the striking force.<br><br>

Of course, the army command, military designers and industrialists of the Middle Kingdom decided to keep up with the rest of the world powers and closely engaged in promising developments. This is how the history of the Type 97 began.<br><br>



The trigger mechanism allows you to fire in automatic and single mode. Food is supplied from 30-round magazines. On top of the receiver is a removable carrying handle, and there are mounting brackets for a variety of sights.<br><br>



In combat, the Type 97 proved to be a reliable and effective weapon. The advantages of the weapon are many: weight, relative simplicity of design and a decent rate of fire.<br><br>



Minus: the window for extracting spent cartridges is located on the right side of the rifle at the level of the shooter's face, which practically eliminates the use of the machine gun by left-handers.<br><br>
