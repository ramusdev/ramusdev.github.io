<h4>Historical note</h4>
Smoothbore automatic shotgun Auto Assault-12 (AA-12), developed in the early 70-ies in the USA designer Maxwell Atchisson. The gun was established on the basis of the earlier work "Atchisson Assault Shotgun".<br><br>

The gun with enormous firepower, but at a low rate, was invented in the era of the Vietnam war because it assumed a rich sleep with buckshot and buckshot all sorts of bushes and thickets in the jungle where he was hiding opponents.<br><br>

Atchison was not weapons-industrialist and in the middle of 2000-h years the American company "Military Police System" gets the rights to the AA-12, hoping to start production for the police and armed forces of the United States. Also using the ideas of Atchison in South Korea was developed automatic shotgun "USAS-12".<br><br>

The main difference between "AA-12" from the "Atchisson Assault Shotgun" — the use of gas operated automatics due to the use of more powerful cartridges. Was also changed the design of the USM and the receiver made integral with the butt and forend. br><br>

As in "AAS", the shutter is rolled back in the butt. The new receiver consists of left and right halves fastened to each other by pins. Interpreter modes of fire is located near the trigger and can be fired single or continuous bursts.<br><br>
