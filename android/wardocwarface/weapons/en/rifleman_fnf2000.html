<h4>Historical note</h4>

The FN F2000 is a Belgian machine developed by "Fabrique Nationale de Herstal". The FN F2000 was first introduced in 2001. This weapon is designed for combat tasks in modern local military conflicts.<br><br> 

Developed in the late 90-ies, it has been made since 2001-2002.<br><br>

Automation F2000 is valid due to the removal of powder gases, locking barrel by turning the bolt. The layout of the bullpup.<br><br> 

Thanks to a patented scheme of the front extraction of spent cartridges (cartridges almost fall out the muzzle) is the main problem of the weapons of this layout is the inability to use weapons shooter-left-handed because of the falling shell casings in the face.<br><br>

This weapon can be used by both left-handed and right-handed without modifications in contrast to the Steyr AUG or the FAMAS.<br><br> 

The bilateral location of the fuse/interpreter modes of fire under the trigger guard also provides a "bilateralization" of the system. Currently under development, and modifications under a special under-barrel shotgun.<br><br>

The quality of materials used polymers, the forend is plastic, easily removable, on which can be installed various additional modules: laser pointer, flashlight, 40mm grenade launcher, "non-lethal" module М303, intended for shooting with capsules containing paint or tear gas. In the future, at the request of customer is possible to install other modules.<br><br>

Standard sight — optical ratio of 1.6 X with a wide field of view. It can be quickly replaced by any other sight that has the appropriate attachment, such as a special computerized control module fire.<br><br>

This module includes a laser rangefinder and ballistic computer, exposing the reticle sight for the firing of the machine gun, and grenade launcher (if installed), which is based on the target range.<br><br>

With this module F2000 can be seen as a cheaper analogue of the American system OICW.
