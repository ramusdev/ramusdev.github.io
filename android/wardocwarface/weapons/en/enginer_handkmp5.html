<h4>Historical note</h4>
Heckler & Koch Maschinenpistole 5 (H&K MP5) is a submachine gun of 9 mm caliber was first introduced by the firm Heckler & Koch in 1966, under the name HK54. This name was chosen according to the old numbering system models of the firm: the number "5" defined the weapons as a PP, and the number "4" has determined that PP was created under the cartridge 9×19 mm Parabellum.<br><br>

The final name he received after mid-1966, the Federal government took it on Board, police and border service as the MP5.<br><br>

In the future, MR5 purchased in a variety of police and army forces in both Europe and other continents. Particularly the MP5 became popular after the whole world saw it in the hands of British commandos from the SAS during counterterrorism operations for the liberation of the Iranian Embassy in England in 1980, and a number of others.<br><br>

Structurally, the MP5 is nothing more than a reduced pistol cartridge copy of the German rifle H&K G3. He inherited from the G3 and a stamped steel receiver with flip-down and detachable module's trigger mechanism (USM), and prosobonia the shutter with a slow roll back with the help of a pair of rollers.<br><br>

Fire from the MP5 always is a closed bolt, which increases accuracy and shooting accuracy, but increases the probability of self-ignition of a cartridge in the barrel by overheating of the weapons.<br><br>

For this a groove for the bolt handle (on the left above the barrel) has a special cutout in the back where you can make a handle and to thereby lock the shutter in the rear (open) position. This will allow the barrel to cool better without the danger of accidental discharge.<br><br>

To continue fire it is only necessary to withdraw the bolt handle from the neck and release it, then pull the trigger.<br><br>

USM is completely similar to the MP5 USM rifles G3 and is located in the detachable housing with pistol grip. Early versions USM stamped from sheet steel, the modern flow of plastic integral with pistol grip and trigger guard.<br><br>

The trunks of the early models of (N&K-54, MP5) had a double slit compensator in the muzzle part. On the trunk there are three radial stops for fastening quick-detachable silencers. Sights consisted of an open front sight and flip the L shaped rear sight.<br><br>

Currently, the MP5 is in service with police forces in many European countries, including Spain, Britain, Germany, and also in the US police, the Navy and the Marine Corps, and many more where. Apart from Germany, the MP5 is manufactured under license in Greece, Mexico, Pakistan and Turkey.<br><br>

By the way, the MP5 is included in the armament of the special forces of the police of the German GSG 9. Its success obliged the MP5 such properties as reliability, easy handling, high accuracy.
