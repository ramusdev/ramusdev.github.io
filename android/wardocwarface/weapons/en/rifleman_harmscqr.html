 <h4>Historical background</h4>

This is a lightweight rifle with excellent ergonomics, developed in Germany on the AR-15 platform. The weapon uses Magpul drum magazines and has increased stability when conducting automatic fire.<br><br>

HArms CQR will certainly interest collectors — the gun stands out for its unusual futuristic design.

The CQR system was developed by the German company Hera Arms from Lower Franconia and is a body kit for the American semi-automatic rifle AR-15. <br><br>



The automatic version of the AR-15, which is a civilian and regular weapon of the American police, is widely known as the M16-it was under this index that it was adopted by the US Army. This rifle served as a platform for many modifications and clones that were developed around the world.<br><br>



The SQR stands for "Close Quarter Rifle". The system is one of the most compact modifications of the AR platform. <br><br>



The body kit is made of polymer materials, as a result of which it is lightweight and highly durable, and the ergonomics of the butt shape and the presence of the front handle provide a reliable grip and ease of use of the rifle. <br><br>



The rounded design and the absence of protruding parts allow you to quickly bring the weapon into combat position without the risk of catching on the equipment elements. Also, like all modern guns, the rifle is equipped with a Picatinny rail, on which you can install sights for a variety of needs.<br><br>
