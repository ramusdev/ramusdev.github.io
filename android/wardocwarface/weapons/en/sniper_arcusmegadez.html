<h4>Advantages</h4>

- High damage<br>

- Good shooting range<br>

- A spacious store



<h4>Disadvantages</h4>

- Long cooldown<br>

- Not modifiable



<h4>Weapon Features</h4>

This weapon deals huge damage, but at the same time it overheats very quickly, which makes it unwise to use it against ordinary enemies. However, it is extremely effective against:<br><br>



- the third mini-boss Antey-6<br>

- against the final boss and its built-in EMP weapons<br><br>



The mini-boss will not stand against such weapons: two shots take away all his armor, which allows you to very quickly proceed directly to his destruction. Megadez can also break the EMP weapon on Terraformer 1 and in the final boss battle with two or three shots.<br><br>



By the way, with the help of this weapon, you can also beat with the butt. Although this method deals huge damage, this method of combat is actually ineffective, because bots can also use this technique in response, so it is still recommended to shoot with ARCUS Scout when close contacts are made.<br><br>
