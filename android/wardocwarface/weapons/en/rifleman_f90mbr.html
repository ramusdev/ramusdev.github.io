A light assault rifle developed by the Australian company Thales. Allows the shooter to swim with a rifle and open fire immediately after leaving the water, so great for amphibious troops who land in the seas.



<h4>Combat Effectiveness</h4>



The F90 MBR in Warface is an assault rifle with impressive damage and range. Balanced characteristics make it a universal means of eliminating the enemy at almost any distance. <br><br>



The main competitor of the F90 MBR is the AK-12, from which the rifle differs in a higher rate of fire and recoil force (it can be compensated by installing a unique handle).<br><br>



The machine has a unique handle, and also deals increased damage to the limbs.<br><br>

<h4>Advantages</h4>

- High rate of fire<br>

- Easily controlled recoil<br>

- Unique handle<br>



< h4>Disadvantages</h4>

- Average accuracy when shooting from the hip



<h4>Historical background</h4>

The F90 MBR was presented at the international defense technology exhibition DSEi 2017 by the Australian division of Thales, a major manufacturer of military equipment. The platform for the novelty was the F90 rifle, which was in service with the Australian Defense Forces — and it, in turn, is a deep modernization of the F88. <br><br>



The new rifle has a gas-discharge automatic and a trigger mechanism of the original design, but differs in the presence of a bolt delay, which was absent from the previous rifles of the AUG family. Caliber F90MBR — 5.56×45 mm NATO.<br><br>



Thanks to the "bull-pop" layout with a relatively short body, the F90 MBR has a long barrel that provides optimal muzzle velocity, excellent range and accuracy. <br><br>



And if you add to the small size and the use of composite materials in the design, then we get one of the lightest assault rifles on the market: its weight is 3.25 kg. <br><br>



The convenience and versatility of the rifle add the ability to quickly change barrels (MBR in the name means "modular bullpup rifle") and the presence of two-way controls. The F90MBR uses standard NATO slats and magazines.<br><br>
