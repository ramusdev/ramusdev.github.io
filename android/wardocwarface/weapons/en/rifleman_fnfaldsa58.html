<h4>Historical background</h4>

In the game, the FN FAL DSA 58 comes with a unique DSA-58 tactical grip, which significantly increases the accuracy of shooting from the hip due to the laser designator.<br><br>



The Belgian FN FAL assault rifle, along with the Kalashnikov assault rifle and the M16, is one of the world's most widely used examples of automatic small arms. In different countries, there are many modifications of it. One of the most popular "clones" of the FN FAL was the DSA 58 version, produced in the United States by DS Arms.<br><br>

This version of the rifle, designed for police use, has a shortened to 11-inch barrel, a RIS-handguard and a Picatinny rail on the receiver cover. The pistol grip has been replaced with a more ergonomic one. 7. 62x51 NATO caliber cartridges are used, the fire modes are automatic and single.<br><br>



The FN FAL is essentially not an assault rifle, but an automatic rifle. During operation, it has proved to be a relatively reliable and unpretentious weapon. Despite the emergence of more modern weapons, the time-tested FN FAL remains effective in its tactical niche.<br><br>



It takes the 5th place in the rating of the ten best rifles and submachine guns of the XX century according to the Military Channel.<br><br>
