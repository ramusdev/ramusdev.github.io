<h4>Historical background</h4>

The SR-2 "Veresk" submachine gun was designed by Klimovsky FSPU "TSNIITOCHMASH" on the instructions of the FSB of Russia in the mid-1990s.<br><br>



For the first time, this submachine gun was shown in 1999 under the designation SR-2 (Special Development 2) and the name "Heather". The 9-mm SR-2 submachine gun is an automatic melee weapon and is designed to engage human forces, including those using personal protective equipment, at ranges up to 200 m.<br><br>



SR-2 "Veresk" provides 100% penetration of 4-mm steel sheet at a distance of 70 m. The Veresk submachine gun is designed for the use of various cartridges of the 9x21 mm series:<br><br>

The SR-2M "Veresk" submachine gun operates on the basis of gas-discharge automation with a long working stroke of the gas piston. The gas piston located above the barrel is rigidly connected to the bolt carrier. <br><br>



The piston is made hollow and a return spring is placed inside it with its front part. Locking the barrel is carried out for the cutouts in the receiver by turning the bolt with six combat stops.<br><br>



When fired, the gas piston together with the bolt carrier moves backward, turning the bolt. Next, the barrel is unlocked and the spent cartridge case is ejected, then the bolt sends the next cartridge into the chamber and locks the barrel channel.<br><br>



The device of automation with a rigid locking of the barrel in submachine guns is extremely rare and is due to the use of a powerful cartridge in the weapon. The cocking handle is rigidly fixed on the right side of the bolt carrier.<br><br>



The trigger mechanism of the trigger type allows you to fire both single shots and bursts. The safety lever is located on the right side of the receiver and has two positions marked with the letters " O "- fire and "P" - safety.<br><br>



The lever of the translator of types of fire is placed on the left side of the weapon. It also has two positions marked with one and three dots — single shots and automatic fire, respectively.<br><br>



CP-2 submachine guns are equipped with front holding handles fixed in the front part of the forearm. The weapon is equipped with a metal folding butt, which folds up in the marching position.<br><br>



The butt has a spring-loaded back plate, which allows you to quickly move the weapon from the marching position to the shooting position with a focus on the shoulder, and the way it is placed in the folded state reduces the transverse dimensions.<br><br>



The cartridges are fed from detachable box magazines with a staggered arrangement of 30 cartridges and their output in two rows. The magazines are inserted into the pistol grip of the fire control. The magazine latch is double-sided.<br><br>



Standard sighting devices are mechanical, open, but collimator sights can be attached to the receiver cover.<br><br>

The small size and weight of this submachine gun, combined with the original suspension for carrying it under clothing, ensure its concealed carrying and quick transfer to the combat position.<br><br>



At the same time, the SR-2 "Veresk" provides a reliable defeat of the enemy, protected by bulletproof vests, at ranges up to 100 meters when using SP-10 cartridges with armor-piercing bullets. CP-2 works reliably in various operating conditions in the temperature range from -50 ° C to +50 ° C.<br><br>



The SR-2 Veresk submachine guns are currently in service with the FSB and the FSO of the Russian Federation. In addition, Veresk submachine guns are also used in other law enforcement agencies of Russia, in special purpose units.
