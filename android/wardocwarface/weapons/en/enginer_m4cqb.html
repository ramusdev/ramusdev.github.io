<h4>Historical note</h4>
M4 Close Quarters Battle (CQB) is a versatile submachine gun, a modification of the M16A2 with a shortened barrel 262 mm.<br><br>

The M4 carbines and M16 rifles are not always ideally suited to perform a variety of missions, therefore, it was proposed to use the modularity of the M16 series rifles that will enable the soldier to change the upper part of the receiver and thus to modify the weapon for a specific combat mission.<br><br>

One of the two proposed solutions was the "kit" SOPMOD (Special Operations Peculiar Modification), a different solution was CQB (Close Quarters Battle).<br><br>

The main objective, pursued in the development of the M4 CQB was the creation of weapons, comparable in size to a submachine gun, but firing a more powerful intermediate cartridges and assault rifles, for such tasks as the protection of VIPs, the battle in the city, and other clashes at close range (CQB).<br><br>
