<h4>Historical note</h4>
Type 97 In the 80 — ies of XX century in the defence industry there is a tendency to reduce the gauge of a firearm. This helps to reduce recoil and improve shooting accuracy with little loss in destructive power. Of course, the army command, the military engineers and Industrialists of China decided not to lag behind other world powers and come to grips with the promising developments. So begins the story of the Type 97.<br><br>

By the time in service of the people's Liberation Army of China consisted mainly of rifle caliber 7.62x39 mm: in particular, the Type 56 rifles and machine guns Type 81. In the late 1980s, the Chinese command has set a clear goal: to develop its own small-caliber cartridge and the weapon, where it will be used. The designers took as a basis the latest at the time DBP87 cartridge caliber 5.8x42 mm, which was positioned as an alternative to the cartridges 5.. 45x39 mm Soviet and 5.56х45 mm NATO.<br><br>

As already mentioned, the Type 97 is built on the principle bullpup, i.e. the store is located behind the handle. In the basis of automation — the gas engine with a short stroke of the piston. The rotary shutter and closes the trunk on 3 lugs.<br><br>

The trigger mechanism allows you to fire in auto and single modes. Power is supplied from stores in 30 rounds. On top of the receiver is a removable carrying handle, also there are mounting mounts for various sights.<br><br>

In combat, the Type 97 proved itself as a reliable and effective weapon. Plus, weapons are many: weight, relative simplicity of design and a decent rate of fire. Minus: a window extraction of spent cartridges is on the right side of the rifle at the face level arrow, which virtually eliminates the use of automatic left-handed.
