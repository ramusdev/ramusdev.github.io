  <h4>Historical background</h4>



The Gilboa Snake DBR is a double-barreled automatic rifle developed in Israel by Silver Shadow.<br><br>



The Gilboa Snake rifle has two side-by-side barrels mounted in a common receiver made of aluminum alloy. Between the barrels there is a common gas block, into which the powder gases from both barrels are discharged. <br><br>



A single gas piston, passing between and above the barrels, acts on two bolt frames, each of which has a rotary shutter. The shutters are made of mirror, and in the receiver there are two windows for spent cartridges, so that the ejection of cartridges is made simultaneously on both sides of the weapon. <br><br>



The ammunition is fed from two independent box magazines inserted into the weapon from the bottom. Standard magazines from the M16 rifle are used.<br><br>
