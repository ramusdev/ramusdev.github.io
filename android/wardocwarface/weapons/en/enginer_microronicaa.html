<h4>Historical background</h4>



The Israeli company CAA Tactical is one of the world leaders in the production of modern accessories for tuning small arms. Its clients include the armed forces and law enforcement agencies around the world.<br><br>



This year, at the SHOT Show, the company presented a new model of the Micro-Roni carbine platform for pistols — a compact kit for converting a pistol into a carbine by installing a short-barreled weapon in a case with already prepared accessories.<br><br>



The Micro-Roni platform is made of aluminum alloy and durable black plastic. It is suitable for Glock pistols of various models. Such compact designs have recently become extremely popular.<br><br>



For example, the already familiar folding submachine gun Magpul FMG-9 is assembled on a similar principle-based on the Glock 18 pistol. <br><br>

The Micro-Roni differs from many other similar kits in that it is not necessary to disassemble the gun for mounting the weapon — you only need to install the reload handle on it, place it in the platform and lock it with a latch, which takes less than 5 seconds. <br><br>



The rapid conversion of a regular service pistol into a carbine dramatically increases the range and accuracy of shooting, making it actually a submachine gun, and gives police officers the opportunity to confront terrorists on an equal footing, often equipped with long-barreled self-loading and automatic weapons.<br><br>
