<h4>Historical note</h4>
Pump-action shotgun the DP-12 designed and manufactured by the American arms company Standard Manufacturing. This is a highly unusual shotgun designed to combine all the advantages, but also inevitably and disadvantages of two different systems – the double-barrelled guns and store guns with pump action reloading.<br><br>

This weapon can be used both for hunting and for protection and recreational shooting.<br><br>

Shotgun the DP-12 uses a manual reload with a movable forearm. Actually this weapon is a normal "pump" shotgun, merged into one common receiver of aluminum alloy and plastic housing, with a common movable forend and single selective trigger. The locking barrels by swinging larvae of the shutter by mating with the shank of the trunk. br><br>

The paddles have shafts separate, however, when recharging they move synchronously. Stores tubular, under-barrel, each store feeds only one barrel independently of the other. The trigger mechanism is of the selective type, with single trigger and double trigger.<br><br>

After each recharge cycle (one movement of the forearm back and forth) the shooter can shoot twice, double-tapping the trigger (like on a standard shotgun). The first fires the right barrel, the second pressing down – left.<br><br>
