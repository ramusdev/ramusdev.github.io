  <h4>Historical background</h4>

FN SCAR-L PDW (eng. Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle-Light Personal Defense Weapon) - a shortened machine gun developed by the American division of the Belgian company "FN Herstal" in 2005 and produced by " FNH USA Inc.".<br><br>



In 2003, the US CSR (USSOCOM) published the requirements for the new SCAR modular assault rifle. The new weapon was supposed to replace the American special forces obsolete M4A1 carbines, M16, M14 and SR-25 assault rifles. <br><br>



In December 2004, according to the results of the competition, the weapon system of the company "FN Herstal"was declared the winner.<br><br>



The automation system is powered by a gas exhaust engine with a short stroke of the gas piston. Locking the barrel bore is carried out by turning the bolt on 3 combat stops. Shooting is conducted with a closed shutter. A rotary switch of the gas regulator is mounted on the front side of the gas chamber.<br><br>



The L-shaped gate frame has an elongation at the top, the front wall of which rests against the gas piston. USM-trigger type, designed as a single module and allows you to fire single shots or continuous bursts.<br><br>



The barrel is removable, quick — change. The barrel is fixed with 6 screws, and its replacement requires only one tool and takes only a couple of minutes. At the front of the barrel there is a removable slotted flame extinguisher, which allows you to install a quick-release silencer on top of it.<br><br>



The receiver is made of two halves: the upper aluminum, which accommodates the bolt group with the barrel, and the lower plastic, on which the pistol grip with controls, the magazine receiver and the USM module are located. These halves are connected by means of a cross pin located in the front part of the lower half.<br><br>



The cocking handle is removable and can be mounted on either side of the weapon. The handle is attached directly to the bolt carrier and moves with it when firing. In front of the handle slot on both sides of the weapon, there are holes for cooling the barrel, covered by an elongated front part of the bolt carrier.<br><br>



On top of the receiver, as well as on the lower and side sides of the forearm, there are Picatinny rail guides, which allow you to put any collimator and optical sights with appropriate mounts, as well as various handles.<br><br>



The standard SCAR-L PDW is equipped with removable sighting devices, including a folding adjustable diopter sight mounted on a guide, and an adjustable folding front sight in an annular muzzle mounted on the gas chamber.<br><br>



The butt and pistol grip are made of high-strength plastic. The butt is simplified, non-adjustable and equipped with an adjustable cheek. On the back of the butt has a wide rubber recoil pad and sling swivel for mounting weapons belt. Also, there are swivels on both sides of the receiver, front and rear.<br><br>



The machine is fed with cartridges from two-row magazines for 30 rounds. The SCAR-L PDW can use magazines from M16 or AR-15 type rifles. 5.56×45 mm NATO cartridges are used to power the weapon.<br><br>



The SCAR-L PDW as a whole is a modern, simple, reliable, accurate and flexible weapon with high combat characteristics. Thanks to the simple design and the short-stroke gas piston circuit, this machine is highly reliable and resistant to contamination.<br><br>



This version of the machine gun was developed as a personal defense weapon for helicopter crews, combat vehicles, technicians, etc. In 2005, the SCAR-L PDW machine guns began to enter service with American Rangers in Afghanistan and Iraq.<br><br>
