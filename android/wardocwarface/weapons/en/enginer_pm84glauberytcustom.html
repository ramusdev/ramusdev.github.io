Compact Polish submachine gun, characterized by high accuracy and allowing to cause serious damage at close range.

<h4>Purchase</h4>

Comes Warbucks for a certain period.

<h4>Battle performance</h4>

The main differences of these weapons from other PP — shooting-off in four rounds and high damage. Weapons are not endowed with fantastic range, so the effective distance for him to be close.<br><br>

To the store fit PP 32 pistol cartridges, which, when firing, given the principle of fire, very quickly spent, standard ammo is 192 rounds. The weapon has medium reload speed.<br><br>

The kick butt is a fast, inflict moderate damage.<br><br>

To modify available in two modular slots with all range of equipment for the engineer, so you can easily adjust the weapon to any style of game.<br><br>

This weapon can be used at tournaments Warface.

<h4>Advantages</h4>
- High damage<br>
- A good rate of fire for PP, shoot clipping<br>
- Good accuracy from the hip<br>
- Weak recoil is almost not noticeable.<br>
- Two slots of modifications with the whole range of equipment for the engineer

<h4>Disadvantages</h4>
- A small range<br>
- Poor accuracy in the aiming mode

<h4>Historical note</h4>
PM-84 Glauberyt (Polish. yeah maszynowy wz.84) is a Polish 9 mm submachine gun developed in the early 1980-ies of the designers Ryszard Chelmicki, Janusz Hancewicze and Stanislav BRICs for the Polish army and police to replace the not quite successful submachine gun PM-63 RAK.<br><br>

Adopted in 1984. There were separate categories of the military (paratroopers, the crews of armored vehicles), police, border guards, railway, and postal security.<br><br>

From the first glance it is clear that PM-84 Glauberyt is more than just the enhanced version of the PM-63 with some technological improvements, to which was added the design points, borrowed from UZI.<br><br>

Available PM-84 Glauberyt factory "Slayed Metalowe" which is a solely state-owned weapons factory producing at the time, the Wz.63. Project work in PM-84 Glauberyt was conducted in the centre for development and research of Radom under the leadership of Chief designer Richard Helmick.<br><br>

PM-84 looks like a slightly elongated PM-63. The principle of operation of automation remains the same — the free-bolt recoil, which before firing is in the front position and a back cartridge in the chamber.<br><br>

Therefore, PM-84 Glauberyt a spring-loaded striker and a trigger located inside the receiver. Used cartridge remained the same — 9x18 mm Makarov, although the weapon can easily be adapted for firing a cartridge 9x19mm Parabellum (PM-84P).<br><br>

The stores remained unchanged from the PM-63 and inserted into the pistol grip, which is made checki single piece of black plastic.<br><br>

The details of the weapon made mostly by stamping from sheet metal and heat resistant plastic. In appearance the PM-84 Glauberyt looks like a cross between a PM-63 and normal UZI. On the muzzle of the barrel can be installed muffler.<br><br>

In the pistol grip, PM-84 Glauberyt is the mechanism of slowing the rate of fire, similarly as in the Czech Skorpion vz 61. It has a spring loaded inertia retarder, which moves up and down, perpendicular to the axis of the bore. Despite its complexity, this mechanism is apparently quite effective when rate of fire is only 600 rounds per minute.<br><br>

It is remarkable that the PM-84 Glauberyt there are two ways to switch firing modes. Immediately behind the pistol grip on the housing of the receiver is the interpreter-fuse. Its top position corresponds to the position of "protection".<br><br>

At this position the shutter and the trigger is blocked. The rotation of the interpreter in the middle position will correspond to the semi-automatic mode. In the lower position of the gun will be automatic gunfire. br><br>

In addition, in the same way as on the PM-63 with a slight press of the trigger you can fire single shots, it shooting will be automatic.<br><br>

In the case of the receiver, PM-84 Glauberyt installed the rear sight. Retractable butt PM-84 Glauberyt, made of metal rod, perhaps, fragile and inferior in strength to the butt Wz.63. Extends and retracts it in the same way.<br><br>

That before firing the shutter is in the front position, and the iron sights are not set on the moving parts of the weapon, all this should significantly improve the accuracy of the PM-84 Glauberyt. Slightly more weight due to the increased size should lead to greater stability of the weapon when firing from the shoulder, compared with the PM-63.
