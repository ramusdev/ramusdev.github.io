Combat 12-gauge shotgun based on the Kalashnikov assault rifle, available in different versions. Works by removal of powder gases through a hole in the wall of the bore.

<h4>Purchase</h4>

The saiga can be bought in the game store ("Arms") for Warbucks after its opening from suppliers ("Rare").

<h4>Battle performance</h4>

Compared to its competitor in the category of "Rare" Hawk Pump, the saiga looks better. Saiga can act on the near and middle distance, especially if you shoot "in sight".<br><br>

The only problem in PvP are the doctors with pump-action shotguns, so they better stay away or try to catch on the middle distance.<br><br>

Saiga is equally suitable for all game modes and does not require special skill. The perfect weapon for the player, which is still mastered in the game.<br><br>

The use of this weapon is allowed in tournaments Warface.

<h4>Advantages</h4>
- The universal weapon<br>
- Good rate of fire<br>
- Good range<br>
- 2 slots for modifications<br>

<h4>Disadvantages</h4>
- Rarely kills with the first shot<br>
- High enough damage

<h4>Historical note</h4>
By the end of the 90s, on the basis of the layout of the Kalashnikov assault rifle was created smooth bored shotgun saiga to be a hunting cartridge 12 gauge, which is one of the most powerful models of semi-automatic weapons.<br><br>

However, the saiga is applied not only to civil arrows on the competitions in practical shooting, but also is of great interest for professionals as a powerful assault weapon.<br><br>

The main feature of the saiga is its layout: the earlier versions had a simple venting mechanism allow the use of only standard, 70 mm, ammunition. The gas regulator has made it possible to fire cartridges of the type "Magnum" and "promagnum", which has a much larger powder charge.<br><br>

The weapon comes in four major versions: the "saiga-12", "saiga-12C", "saiga-12K", "saiga-12C EXP-01" (export variant), characterized poliestireno or pistol grip, barrel length and butt folded limiting the firing.<br><br>

The functionality of the weapon confirmed sighting devices including the bar for mounting red dot sights or night vision devices, and laser target designators. Capacity box stores are 2, 5 and 8 rounds.<br><br>

The developers have positioned it as a weapon of "universal" arrow — equally well adapted for self-defense, practical or recreational shooting and hunting at short distances. The military origin and the pursuit of the universalization determined the pros and cons of the model.
