 <h4>Historical background</h4>



The M240B is a single machine gun developed by the designer Ernest Verviers in the 1950s and produced by the American company "U.S. Ordnance". The M240B machine gun is a modification of the Belgian FN MAG machine gun.<br><br>



The M240B is an automatic weapon, built according to the scheme with gas-driven automation and locking the barrel. The gas outlet unit is located under the barrel and has a gas regulator to control the rate of fire and adapt to external conditions.<br><br>



Locking is carried out by means of a special swinging lever mounted on the gate and connected to the gas piston rod. When locking, the lever turns downwards, engaging with the stop at the bottom of the receiver and thereby supporting the bolt from behind.<br><br>



The barrel of the machine gun is designed to be quick-change, it has a carrying handle, which is also used when replacing the hot barrel, as well as a front sight on a high base. The barrel bore and breech are chrome-plated.<br><br>



The receiver of the machine gun is made of stamped parts, reinforced with steel plates and rivets. Its front part is reinforced to install the barrel and gas cylinder couplings, which are made non-removable.<br><br>



At the bottom of the receiver there are mounts for mounting the machine gun on infantry machines or equipment. When used as a machine gun, the weapon is mounted on a tripod machine, which provides a greater degree of accuracy and guidance than a bipod.<br><br>



On the gas outlet unit there is a mount on which bipods or handles are installed. The machine gun is equipped with a non-removable butt, which is made of impact-resistant polymer.<br><br>



On the top of the receiver is an open sight. On the receiver of the machine gun, a Picatinny rail type guide is installed, which allows you to put any collimator and optical sights with the appropriate mounts.<br><br>



The power is supplied from a 200-round machine gun metal belt, the supply of cartridges to the chamber is direct. 7.62×51 mm NATO cartridges are used to power the machine gun.<br><br>



The simplicity and reliability of the design in combination with a large ammunition ensured that the machine gun in the weapons system over than 50 countries, including Belgium, Britain, Australia, Canada, USA, Sweden and many other countries.<br><br>
