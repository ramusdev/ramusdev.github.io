In the early 1990s, the rifle was offered the Ministry of the interior as a sniper weapon for the urban environment. MIA has attended VCA for weapons, and also demanded to develop a variant with the possibility of firing bursts.<br><br>

On the accuracy of fire on small and medium range of the VCA roughly analogous to SVD. The possibility of firing bursts in a SVU-A and svu-as is provided for emergencies only (for example, in the melee, creating a real threat to the life of a sniper), because the use of a powerful cartridge and light weight of the rifle cause significant recoil when firing bursts, and a small shop does not lend itself to long shooting.<br><br>

The internals of the rifle in General similar to SVD, except decisions resulting from the used layout, for example, a long pull, connecting the trigger mechanism and the trigger.<br><br>

In the SVU-A and svu-as is modified, the trigger allows you to fire as a single (short press on the trigger), and queues (clicking until it stops or when you enable the ad-hoc interpreter).<br><br>

The barrel is equipped with a massive muzzle cloaking device developed by designer L. V. Bondarev.<br><br>

The muffler reduces the shot noise level by 10-12% compared to SVD, almost completely eliminates muzzle flash and diffuses the sound of the shot so that to determine the exact position of the arrow is impossible.
