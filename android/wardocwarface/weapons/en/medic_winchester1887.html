The famous American weapons designer John Moses Browning initially proposed using a scheme with a longitudinal-sliding reload forearm, which is much more suitable for multi-shot smoothbore rifles.<br><br>



However, the Winchester Repeating Arms Company felt that their new shotgun should have a Henry brace reloading system for reasons of maintaining a uniform style and brand awareness.<br><br>



Having appeared in 1897, the gun was immediately in demand among hunters and policemen. Well, for the mass layman, Winchester 1887 became widely known after the release of a number of popular films.

As with all guns with a Henry bracket, the trigger is open, it can be carefully lowered and put on a preliminary cocking position. In this form, the gun can be safely carried with a cartridge in the chamber, before firing, you only need to cock the trigger.<br><br>



The trigger (as in the "cocked" and in the "lowered") stands for the dimensions of the packing box, in conjunction with the original form, it is almost never can hold on, but while it is convenient to cock and necessary to safely pull, holding a finger.

The M1887 was the first truly successful multi-shotgun. Initially, John Browning suggested the pump mechanism as more suitable for a multi-shot gun, but Winchester insisted on retaining the "lever", more recognizable brand.<br><br>



However, Winchester later introduced the Browning pump-action shotgun: the Model 1893 (an early version of the Model 1897), after the introduction of smokeless powder.
