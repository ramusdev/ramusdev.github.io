<h4>Historical note</h4>

MG3 (it. Maschinengewehr 3) German single gun. Is an improved version of the MG42 machine gun.<br><br>

After the Second World war and the restoration in Germany of the armed forces to his service in 1958 there was the option of a machine gun MG42 chambered in 7.62×51 mm NATO, under the designation MG1. The release of the new machine gun was established концерномRheinmetall AG on the basis of documentation obtained from Grossfuss company.<br><br> 

Since the installation of new production machine guns took a lot of time, the Bundeswehr had to buy abroad a considerable number of machine guns MG42 captured from Nazi Germany, and to tailor them to the cartridge 7.62×51 mm (replacing the barrel and parts of the feed mechanism of the tape). br><br>

Such a converted machine guns got in the Bundeswehr, the index MG2.<br><br>

After some upgrading guns MG1 in the production was launched the final version of the gun, known as the MG3. Thanks to its high technology and combat characteristics, this gun was widely exported, as under his "army" designation and commercial index компанииRheinmetall AG — MG42/59.<br><br>

The MG-3 receiver ribbon is modified so that it can be used as tape nerassypnoy links and loose.<br><br>

It is characterized by a high rate of fire as its predecessor. The rate of bursts depends on the weight of the gate: the lighter the paddle, the higher the rate of gun. br><br>

MG3 available in two variant sets of valves and return springs — standard (gate weight of about 600 grams), providing a rate of fire of 1200 rounds per minute, and heavy (shutter weighs about 900 grams) for a rate of fire of 800 rounds per minute. br><br>

Because of the high rate of under intensive shooting, you must change the barrel every 250 shots. Replacing the stem is 6 — 10 seconds.<br><br>

Is in service with the Bundeswehr and widely exported to various countries. Is also produced under license in Austria, Greece, Iran, Pakistan, Mexico, Sudan, Spain and Turkey.<br><br> 

Although a prototype of the gun was released over 50 years ago, the MG3 remains a highly effective and popular weapon. But in the German production MG3 is stopped, and the infantry is being gradually replaced with a more lightweight and maneuverable, but less powerful machine gun HK MG4 5.56 mm.
