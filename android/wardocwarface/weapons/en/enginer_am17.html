- High accuracy of shooting in the aiming mode<br>

- High accuracy when shooting from the hip<br>

- Good range<br>

- High penetration capacity



  < h4>Disadvantages</h4>

  - Missing<br>



  <h4>Historical background</h4>

The AM-17 from the Kalashnikov Concern was presented at the Army-2017 forum. Its prototype was designed by the legendary gunsmith Yevgeny Dragunov back in the seventies. Then he received the designation MA-small-sized machine. <br><br>



According to the manufacturer, the novelty is intended for the calculations of military equipment and special forces, and in the future it can replace the AKS-74U, which was removed from the assembly line at the end of the last century.<br><br>



The receiver, unlike the AK-series weapon, is made in the form of two receivers connected by a hinge and fixed in the working position with a pin. For maintenance, the elements of the receiver are disconnected, and the weapon "breaks". <br><br>



In the upper part of the receiver, the barrel and parts of the automatic elements with a gas engine are mounted, the lower receiver includes parts of the trigger mechanism and the magazine receiving shaft. The pistol grip and trigger guard are made as a single unit with the receiver.<br><br>



The total length of the AM-17 is 740 mm, the length of its barrel is 230 mm. The magazine capacity is 30 rounds of 5. 45x39 mm caliber. The weight of the machine without a magazine is 2.5 kg. The AM-17 is equipped with a right-folding butt. The Picatinny rail is also integrated into the design, which allows you to attach sighting devices and flashlights.<br><br>
