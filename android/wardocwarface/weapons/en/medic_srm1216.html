<h4>Historical note</h4>
SRM 1216 - shotgun 12-gauge. Shotgun designed and manufactured by the American company SRM Arms Inc.

SRM 1216 unusual uses for shotguns semi-automatic shutter. Slowing opening the shutter is done with the help of a pair of rollers, similar to the system found in the German weapons firm Heckler & Koch (such as G3 or MP5), as well as in earlier German Sturmgewehr 44 machine.<br><br>

Of course the gun has a bullpup layout, with plastic housing and steel receiver box, connected by transverse pins. Ejection of spent cartridges can be arranged on the right and on the left side of the weapons by moving some of the details with incomplete dismantling weapons.<br><br>

Very original different power system cartridges. The SRM 1216 shotgun is equipped with barrel, a detachable rotary magazine capacity of 16 rounds, in fact, which is a block of four parallel tubular stores for 4 rounds each, arranged in parallel in a single package.<br><br>

The body shop has the ability to rotate the weapon so that each time the feeding of cartridges is only one (upper) tubular magazine out of the unit. After firing all cartridges in the "working" segment of the magazine, the slide of the weapon gets on the packing latency and remains in the open position.<br><br>

After that, the shooter needs to press one of two keys of a latch located on each side of the store in the front part, and rotate the block for 90 degrees in any direction, so that in the operating (upper) position up to the next full segment of the store.<br><br>

After rotating the block store is fixed in the working position, the first cartridge from the top of the tube will automatically be sent to the teacher, the shutter can also be automatically removed with the slide stop and toilet the cartridge in the barrel, so the gun is ready to fire.<br><br>

After firing all rounds from all four aisles or at the end of the shooting shop can be removed from the weapon. Press the button shop in the front (under the barrel), and downwards to separate the front part of the store of weapons, and then move forward eject out of the slot in the housing of the weapon.<br><br>

Equipment or replenish store is only possible after separation from the weapon. Loaded store the cartridges are held in a special clamp automatically disable when you install the store into a weapon.<br><br>

The gun is equipped with guide type Picatinny rail on which users depending on their needs and preferences can set different types of collimator sights.<br><br>

This rather unusual design of the shotgun in an obvious way intended primarily for the protection of home and for "police" use, although, in principle, can be used for hunting.
