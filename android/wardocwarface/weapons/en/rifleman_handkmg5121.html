German single machine gun from the company "Heckler & Koch", also known under the name H&K MG5.

<h4>Combat Effectiveness</h4>

The H&K MG5 121 is a versatile weapon that will certainly interest both PvP fans and PvE players. The closest competitor is the Stoner LMG A1, from which the H&K MG5 121 is distinguished by an increased rate of fire, accuracy, a larger magazine, and an increased damage multiplier on the hands. <br><br>

All this is compensated by slightly less damage, range of fire and ammunition. The H&K MG5 121 comes with two unique modules. <br><br>

The first is the handle, which provides a reduction in recoil, spread and withdrawal of the barrel when shooting (except for the prone position). The second is a 1.8-fold Hensoldt ZO sight, which provides fast aiming.

<h4>Advantages</h4>

- High damage<br>
- High rate of fire<br>
- Large store capacity<br>
- Unique modules<br>

<h4>Disadvantages</h4>
- Low accuracy of shooting from the hip<br>
- You can't install a silencer

<h4>Historical background</h4>

The H&K 121 (aka MG5) was introduced in 2009 by the famous weapons company Heckler & Koch is one of the leading suppliers of the German army and police, as well as a number of other countries around the world. The new 7.62 x 51 caliber machine gun was intended to replace the MG3, which had been in service with the Bundeswehr since the late 50s. <br><br>

The basis for the H&K 121, the manufacturer chose its own development-the MG4 light machine gun, the design of which is easily guessed in the novelty.<br><br>

The H&K 121 is only capable of automatic fire, and has a three-position firing rate control for 640, 720, and 800 rounds per minute. In addition to the standard version, the H&K 121 is also available in other versions-a lightweight infantry with a shorter barrel length and several machine guns. <br><br>

The Picatinny rail allows you to install any kind of sights.<br><br>
