<h4>Historical note</h4>

ACR — In 2006, the American arms company Magpul Industries began development of a new complex of small arms. The initial goal was to modernize the appearance of machines the M16, but the engineers Magpul Industries did not stop there and used in the development of some structural elements such weapons as the FN SCAR and the XM8. The work was completed in 4 months. New weapons system was called the Magpul Masada ACWS (eng. Adaptive Combat Weapon System — the adaptive system of martial weapons).<br><br>

In 2007 demonstrated the first prototypes of the rifle MAGPUL Masada, and in early 2008, another American company Bushmaster Firearms — license the serial production of the weapon. The final version called the Bushmaster ACR (eng. Adaptive Combat Rifle — adaptive assault rifle).<br><br>

The receiver of the machine consists of two parts, the so-called receivers. The upper receiver is made from stamped aluminum and lower is made of durable plastic integral with pistol grip and receiver. Produced in two versions handguard is also made of plastic. The unit is USM combined with a fuse, almost similar to the one in M16. Military weapons are equipped with USM, allows you to fire a single and continuous bursts, and civil — USM allowing only fire single. These blocks are interchangeable.<br><br>
