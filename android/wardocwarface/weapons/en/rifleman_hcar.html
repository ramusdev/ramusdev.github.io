 HCAR is interesting both for snipers who want to go beyond the usual gameplay, and for stormtroopers who want to try something different from their usual machine guns.



 <h4>Acquisition</h4>



 Weapons can be obtained both temporarily and permanently for credits.



 <h4>Combat Effectiveness</h4>

 The HCAR's gameplay features are something new for Warface, as it is the game's first semi-automatic assault rifle. HCAR deals double damage to the body and limbs. In fact, the weapon has a damage of 160 units, and the display on the comparative lines of the TTX is left so as not to break the general perception of assault rifles.<br><br>



 High damage is compensated by a noticeable recoil and a magazine for only 20 rounds.



 <h4>Advantages</h4>

 - Excellent damage<br>

 - Excellent range<br>

 - Excellent rate of fire<br>

 - Excellent accuracy in aiming mode<br>

 - Three slots of modifications with the entire range of equipment for the attack aircraft<br>

 - High penetration ability.



 <h4>Disadvantages</h4>

 - Small store capacity<br>

 - Strong recoil



 <h4>Historical background</h4>



 The HCAR assault rifle, created by the American company Ohio Ordnance Works, was presented to the public relatively recently, in 2013. But everything new is well-forgotten old. It is based on the legendary BAR M1918 machine gun, which was adopted more than a century ago and participated in two world wars.<br><br>

 All the past century, progress has not stood still. From the famous ancestor, the HCAR differs in almost half the weight, the ability to install a muzzle brake, modern butts and sights, but at the same time the caliber has been preserved .30-06 406-mm barrel is covered with oval depressions.<br><br>



 Their purpose is to reduce the weight and improve the cooling of the barrel by increasing its surface area. The rifle is equipped with a modern flame extinguisher, has a gas regulator, a new loading handle and a Mil-Spec telescopic stock.<br><br>
