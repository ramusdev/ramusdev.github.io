VHS-2 Croatian machine gun, made in the layout of the bull-pop. It is equipped with a carrying handle, a length-adjustable buttstock, and spent shell casings ejection windows on both sides of the weapon. 



<h4>Acquisition</h4>



Weapons can be purchased for a time with credits.



<h4>Combat Effectiveness</h4>



VHS-2 is a legendary rifle, the choice of the professional. From other guns, it differs, first of all, in the damage of 84 units, the rate of fire and pliable recoil.<br><br>



The weapon has good characteristics. Excellent damage and range, and high accuracy will allow you to shoot comfortably both at close range and at medium and high distances.<br><br>



Automation is based on the direct discharge of powder gases from the bore to the bolt group, locking is performed by turning the bolt.<br><br>



The body is plastic, the ejection of the cartridges occurs only in the right side (a similar feature of some bull-pop machine guns causes difficulties for left-handed shooters), but the cocking handle of the bolt is located on top and can be bent in both directions for ease of use.<br><br>



The machine has an integral carrying handle, in which the sighting devices are also located and on which, as on the forearm, it is possible to install Picatinny bars. A bayonet-knife can be attached to the barrel, and it is also possible to throw rifle grenades from it.<br><br>



The use of this weapon is allowed in Warface tournaments.



<h4>Advantages</h4>

- Excellent damage<br>

- Excellent shooting range<br>

- Excellent shooting rate<br>

- Excellent accuracy in aiming mode<br>

- Excellent accuracy when shooting from the hip<br>

- 3 modification slots with the entire range of modules<br>

- Good penetration ability



<h4>Disadvantages</h4>

- Requires opening from suppliers<br>



<h4>Historical background</h4>



The VHS was designed to replace the Zastava M70 submachine gun with a weapon that meets NATO standards.<br><br>

The first version with a patented gas recoil buffer of the bolt group, which had a significant external resemblance to the TAR-21, was presented in 2005, but the pre-production version, demonstrated at international exhibitions in 2008, used a conventional spring instead of a buffer, and looked more like a French FAMAS machine gun.<br><br>



The military tests of the weapon were successful, and in 2009 Croatia purchased 1,000 submachine guns of this model.<br><br>
