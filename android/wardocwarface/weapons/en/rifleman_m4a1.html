<h4>Historical note</h4>

M4A1 — carbine, made in the USA on the basis of the M16A2 assault rifle, originally intended for weapons crews of combat vehicles, crews and equipment.<br><br>

Despite this, the special operations command, the United States adopted this rifle as a single piece of armament for all American special operations forces.<br><br>

Currently it goes and the whole Army of the United States, as greater convenience a shortened rifle in modern terms, when most of the army are infantry, vehicle crews and support troops, more than enough compensates for the slight decrease of its characteristics in comparison with the M16A2 assault rifle.<br><br> 

The main differences from the M16A2 M4 carbine is the shorter barrel and telescopic stock.<br><br>

As a rule, indicates that the M4A1 is an M16 with a shortened barrel and shortened Telescopium butt. In fact, the situation is somewhat more complicated: although the M16 and the M4A1 is really based on the same basic model — rifle AR-15, their differences are not limited to the length of the barrel and design of the butt.<br><br>

For example, the process of the M4A1 barrel has the deeper feed ramps that specifies the movement of the cartridges when submitting from the shop (weapons of a family of AR-15 two feed ramps, separately for rounds fed from the left and right rows of the store), and receiver — additional recess under them, which are absent from the M16.<br><br> 

Moreover, the process of the barrel of a M4A1 can be maintaining the functioning of the installed in the receiver of the rifle, but not Vice versa. There are other relatively minor differences.
