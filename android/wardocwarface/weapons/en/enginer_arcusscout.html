A unique weapon that shoots dense clumps of energy. There are several variants of such blasters. This model has an increased rate of fire, but is characterized by a relatively small range of fire.



<h4>Combat Effectiveness</h4>



Arcus series weapons can be obtained in a special launch of the Delta server.<br><br>



The Arcus Scout has excellent stats that are reasonable for an engineer's weapon. The sight is used collimator, so it is better not to fight at long distances.



  <h4>Advantages</h4>

- High damage<br>

- Good range is<br>

- High rate of fire<br>

- High capacity magazine



  < h4>Disadvantages</h4>

- Long recharge time

- Not modifiable



 <h4>Application Recommendations</h4>



This submachine gun is very effective at close range and can cause a lot of damage until it overheats. But even at a long distance, the damage and accuracy in the sight are significantly reduced, which is why there are cases when shots do not hit the enemy. It is recommended to use it against the following opponents:<br><br>



- ordinary people at close range<br>

- against elite (black) TEAMS<br>

- against the mini-boss Antey-6<br><br>



It is more effective to use the Scout version against black horses, because they cannot be killed with a single ARCUS Tactics hit to the head. And on high difficulties — it can not be done even after two. Therefore, in this case, it is easier to deal as much damage to the body as possible. Similarly, with the mini-boss.<br><br>
