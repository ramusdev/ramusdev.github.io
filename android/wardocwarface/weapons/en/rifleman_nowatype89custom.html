<h4>Advantages</h4>

- High rate of fire<br>

- Easily controlled recoil<br>

- Unique modules<br>



<h4>Disadvantages</h4>

<h4>Historical background</h4>

The machine developed in 1989 by the Japanese company Howa Machinery Company Ltd. It is available in three versions-basic, with a folding metal butt, as well as in a modification with a two-way safety-translator and an additional shooting mode with a cut-off of 3 shots.<br><br>



The Howa Type 89 is a landmark gun for Japan, which is still in use today. The model is designed on the basis of the American AR-18 platform, which, in comparison with the AR-15, has a more advanced device with a gas piston that has a short working stroke.<br><br>



A special feature of the Howa Type 89 gas exhaust system is the structure of the gas piston, which consists of two parts. This design provides a two-stage power transfer, which contributes to a smoother operation. <br><br>



The trigger mechanism allows for single and automatic fire. When installing a separate module, it is possible to shoot cut-offs of 3 shots. The body of the model is made of steel, the forearm is made of aluminum, and the butt and handle are made of plastic.<br><br>
