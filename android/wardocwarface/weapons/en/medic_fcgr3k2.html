A new model of an experimental armor-piercing rifle that allows you to hit a target with cluster charges. The use of modified ammunition of increased caliber requires more time to reload compared to the original model.



<h4>Combat Effectiveness</h4>



The FCG-R3 K2 armor-piercing rifle can be obtained in a special launch of the Delta server.<br><br>



The FCG-R3 K2 has high damage, range, and accuracy. In addition, with a non-fatal hit in some cases, the gun is able to overturn the enemy.



<h4>Advantages</h4>

- High damage<br>

- Large magazine capacity and ammunition<br>

- High accuracy when shooting in aiming mode



< h4>Disadvantages</h4>

- Low rate of fire<br>

- Not modifiable



<h4>Historical background</h4>

The shotgun of the American weapons company Kel-Tec CNC Industries was presented in the summer of 2019 at the SHOT Show 2019 in Las Vegas. The novelty, which is based on the KSG (Kel-Tec ShotGun) model, is also built on the bullpup principle - but is thinner, more compact and lighter than the basic version, and also provides only one tubular magazine.<br><br>



The full length of the smooth-bore KS7 with an 18.5-inch barrel does not exceed 663 mm. In the charged state, the KS7 is almost 0.9 kg lighter than the KSG. The shotgun has a polymer carrying handle that protects the mechanical aiming devices and provides M-LOK type mounts, a polymer handguard, a pistol grip and a receiver-butt. <br><br>



All controls are two-sided: designed for both right-handed and left-handed shooters.<br><br>
