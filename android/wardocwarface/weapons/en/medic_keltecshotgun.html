<h4>Historical background</h4>

The Kel-Tec Shotgun is a smoothbore rifle developed in 2011 by the American company "Kel-tec CNC industries" and produced by it to this day. For the first time this shotgun was presented to the public in January 2011 at the gun show "SHOT Show" in Las Vegas. This is the first shotgun produced by Kel-tec CNC.<br><br>


The weapon has a rather unusual design for its type, small dimensions and solid ammunition. First of all, the shotgun is positioned as a self-defense weapon for the civilian population. In addition, it is of interest to law enforcement agencies and security units.<br><br>



On the technical side, the Kel-Tec Shotgun is not an automatic rifle, built according to the "bull-pop"scheme. The shotgun uses a manual reload with a longitudinally sliding handguard. The handguard is made of high-strength plastic and is connected to the shutter by means of two metal rods.<br><br>



 Locking of the barrel bore is carried out by a swinging combat larva, fixed in the upper part of the bolt and coupling it with the barrel shank.<br><br>



In the upper part of the barrel there is a Picatinny rail guide bar, on which various types of open or collimator sights can be installed. An additional guide of the same type is located on the forearm and allows you to put a tactical flashlight, laser sight or front handle.<br><br>



Power is provided from two tubular magazines located parallel to each other under the barrel, each of which holds up to 7 rounds of 12 caliber. The magazines are loaded and the cartridges are ejected from the same window at the bottom of the receiver, behind the pistol grip.<br><br>

At the same time, the supply of cartridges to the barrel is carried out only from one magazine, switching to another magazine is carried out manually, using a lever switch.<br><br>



In the United States, the Kel-Tec Shotgun is gaining popularity among private owners as a weapon for self-defense. This weapon cannot enter the Russian market due to the existing legislation.
