<h4>Disadvantages</h4>

<h4>Historical background</h4>

Truvelo CMS 20x42 mm was first presented in September 2016 at the Africa Aerospace and Defense exhibition in South Africa. This is the next weapon in the line of Counter Measure Sniper rifles (CMS) from the South African company Truvelo Armoury Manufacturers. <br><br>



The main goal of the CMS 20x42 mm project was to reduce the size and weight without compromising the firepower.



The rifle received a rifled barrel of a reduced length of 380 mm, as well as a folding stock, which made it as compact as possible. The length of the Truvelo CMS 20x42 mm in the combat position is only 980 mm, and in the folded position-700 mm. <br><br>



The weight of the weapon with a sight and a loaded magazine is about 11.5 kg.<br><br>



As the name implies, the Truvelo CMS 20x42 mm uses 20x42 mm ammunition, which was originally developed for a promising hand grenade launcher. It is worth noting that the 20 mm is one of the most commonly used calibers of automatic artillery, so the CMS 20x42 mm can be considered a small-caliber gun. <br><br>



For ammunition, detachable box magazines with a capacity of five rounds are provided. <br><br>



The optical sight is mounted on a short Picatinny rail in the upper part of the receiver, two more bars are also on the side surfaces of the cantilever forearm, in the front part of which there are adjustable bipods.<br><br>
