The Knight's Armament Light Assault Machine Gun is a light machine gun system designed by Eugene Stoner and produced by the Knight's Armament Company.



  <h4>Acquisition</h4>



Weapons can be purchased with credits for a while or forever.



  <h4>Combat Effectiveness</h4>

In Warface, the machine gun stands out for its excellent ratio of damage and accuracy, especially in the aimed fire mode. Also, the Stoner LMG A1 reloads quite quickly compared to other models in the class — a complete change of the magazine and bringing the weapon to combat readiness will take about 4 seconds.<br><br>



The machine gun uses an impressive magazine of 180 rounds, and the stormtrooper can take another 540 with him. Among other things, the advantages of the new model include increased damage to the limbs and a comfortable recoil pattern.



  <h4>Advantages</h4>

- Excellent damage<br>

- Excellent range<br>

- Good rate of fire<br>

- Huge store capacity<br>

- High penetration capacity



  <h4>Disadvantages</h4>

- Low accuracy shooting from the hip



 <h4>Historical background</h4>

The first assault machine guns of the American self-taught designer Eugene Stoner were developed back in 1963. They have proven themselves as reliable modular shooting complexes with a fairly high firepower and relatively low weight. The continuation of the Stoner 63 design was a variant of the Stoner 86, introduced by ARES in 1986.<br><br>

It is this more modern model that formed the basis of the new Stoner LMG A1 from Knight's Armament Company, which was first shown to the public in 2015.<br><br>
