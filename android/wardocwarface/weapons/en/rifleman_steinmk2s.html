This is an English model developed in 1941 and entered service with the British Army during the Second World War. The STEN was the country's most mass-produced weapon and came in five different major versions.

<br><br>

All of them had similar parameters: a simple and technologically advanced design, a hammer-type trigger mechanism, a free bolt, a 9×19 mm Parabellum cartridge, the use of a detachable magazine and a sighting range of up to 200 meters. The differences between the models were in some nuances of the design.<br><br>



Model Mk. IIS was developed by order of the Office of Special Operations for the arming of commando units. The modification had a lightweight shutter and an integrated silencer, which was protected from overheating by a special canvas cover with a lace-up. <br><br>



This design was mounted in the receiver instead of the usual barrel with a casing. The weight of the STEN MK IIS was 3.48 kg, length — 900 mm. Among other things, the model had a reduced rate of fire.<br><br>
