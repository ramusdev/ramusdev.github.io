The principle of operation of automation VSS Vintorez — the gases when fired. The rifle has integrated into the design of the expansion silencer with penetrazioni shock wave of the powder gases of the annular elements, diaphragms, and the trunk has a few holes to release pressure in the rear cavity of the muffler. A single exhaust sound of the shot is divided into a sound wave.<br><br>

Reflected from the slanting walls of the separator, waves are superimposed on each other in opposite phases, and mutually absorbed. In addition to the optic, the rifle has an open mechanical sight — adjustable rear sight, digitized to 400 meters, and placed the muzzle of the silencer fly with protective stand.<br><br>

VSS "Vintorez" is not completely silent weapon — the sound of the shot approximates a small-caliber rifle, and can be different only in silence.<br><br>

This is much better than weapons with so-called tactical silencers, wound on the barrel.
