 A modular submachine gun from SIG Sauer, which allows you to fire in bursts with a cut-off of four rounds. The weapon has excellent ergonomics and high reliability when used in difficult conditions.

  ACR CQB can be purchased in the game store ("Kits") in boxes for credits. Buying sets with this PP gives you a chance

  get weapons both permanently and temporarily. Weapons are temporarily removed from sale in the game store.



  <h4>Combat Effectiveness</h4>



 The SIG MPX SBR Custom is a submachine gun with high damage and good range, as well as low recoil.<br><br>



Its main feature is shooting bursts with a cut-off of four rounds. One burst in the body or limbs is enough to deal with the enemy, and at close range, one shot in the head is enough for this.



  <h4>Advantages</h4>

- High damage<br>

- Good range<br>

- A good rate of fire for the PP, shooting cut-offs<br>

- Low return<br>

- Excellent shooting accuracy from the hip



  < h4>Disadvantages</h4>

 - Poor shooting accuracy in aiming mode<br>

- There is no possibility to modify the handguard



  <h4>Historical background</h4>

In 2013, the American division of the world-famous small arms manufacturer SIG Sauer announced a new product-the Sig Sauer MPX submachine gun.<br><br>



This is a modular system that allows the shooter to change the caliber of the weapon (9x19, .357 SIG and .40 S&W) and the length of the barrel without the use of special tools.<br><br>

The SIG Sauer MPX uses gas-discharge automation with a short stroke of the piston located above the barrel, and locking the barrel channel by turning the shutter. The fire is conducted from the closed shutter in bursts and single shots.<br><br>



The design provides for a bolt delay, the bolt handle is located on the back of the receiver, as in the AR-15/M16. Ammunition is supplied using plastic detachable magazines with a capacity of 10, 20 or 30 rounds.<br><br>



There are many modifications of this PP, such as the MPX-SD with a built-in silencer, the shortened MPX-K, the civilian semi-automatic MPX-C, as well as the MPX SBR, which falls into the category of short-barreled rifles, and many other options.<br><br>
