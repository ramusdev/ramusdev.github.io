<h4>Historical note</h4>
XM8 — a complex of small arms, developed jointly by the American arms company ATK (Alliant Techsystems) and the German company Heckler & Koch-based rifles H&K G36.<br>

HM8 developed primarily to replace the M16 rifles and M4A1 with less weight and greater reliability. When using new ammunition with a lightweight composite plastic casing the new machine provided saving weight by 20% compared to the M16.<br>

Start of production of this weapon was scheduled for about 2006. In 2004, the machines have undergone extensive testing in the U.S. armed forces, earning positive reviews. Despite this, in October 2005, the project was officially closed.<br>

HM8 based on automation with a short stroke gas piston, located above the barrel, and locking by a rotating bolt with 7 lugs. The receiver and forend made of durable plastic. <br / >

The butt is adjustable along the length of the telescoping five-position, easily replaceable, also made of plastic. Above the pistol grip is a two-way fuse-translator fire mode, which allows you to fire single shots and continuous bursts. The barrel has a high survivability (over 20,000 shots).<br><br>

Modular configuration allows the use of barrels of different lengths, fitting weapons under specific conditions. Possible configurations: Carbine — the carbine uses a barrel length of 318 mm; Short Carbine and PDW short barrel rifle and personal defense weapon of the crew of combat vehicles, respectively.<br>

Use trunks with a length of 229 mm; Automatic Rifle and Sharpshooter — automatic and sniper rifles that use a barrel length of 508 mm; LMG — a light machine gun that uses a weighted barrel length of 508 mm. Instead of the standard forearm could use a foregrip with integrated bipod.
