<h4>Historical note</h4>

As 'Shaft' (the automatic Machine Special 'Shaft') — noiseless machine, developed in Klimovsk TSNIITOCHMASH designers P. and V. Serdyukov Krasnikov. Created in the second half of the 1980-ies on the basis of the silent sniper rifle VSS 'Vintorez'. 'Shaft' and 'Vintorez' unified at 70 %, which positively affects production and operation.<br><br>

'Shaft' is built on the basis of gas operated automatics with a long stroke gas piston. Gas piston located above the barrel and is rigidly connected to the slide frame. Inside the piston is hollow, and it includes as its front end the mainspring.<br><br>

USM — udarnikov type. Locking barrel by turning the bolt with 6 lugs, with the cutouts in the receiver. The barrel walls are four rows of inclined holes, providing a uniform exhaust gases (part of the gas is given into the chamber of the muffler even when the movement of the bullet in the barrel).<br><br>

The receiver is machined from steel. In comparison with stamping this method improves rigidity, but also increased weight and production cost. To protect against corrosion is applied, the bluing of steel.<br><br>

Butt — tubular, foldable left, metal, durable enough to use in melee, when folded, does not prevent shooting. The rough surface of the pistol grip allows you to firmly hold it, which also contributes to the very form of the arm. Pistol grip, fore-end and double row of shops plastic.<br><br>

The integrated silencer acts as a flame arrester. Thanks to him and the ammo subsonic sound pressure level in the shot is 130 dB.<br><br>

Despite improvements in ergonomics compared to the Kalashnikov fully bilateral weapon "Shaft" can not be called: the arrow you have to take your hand off the pistol grip to deactivate the safety or to distort the bolt handle.<br><br>

It uses special 9mm subsonic ammunition SP-5 and SP-6. Bullet sniper cartridge SP-5 (with steel core) penetrates bullet-proof vests 2 classes or 6 mm steel plate at a range of 100 m and 2 mm at the distance of aimed fire, thus keeping energy, sufficient for destruction of the enemy had taken refuge.<br><br>

Armor-piercing cartridge SP-6 with a larger core of hardened steel can bring down the car easily and even armored vehicles. It penetrates 8 mm steel plate at a range of 100 m and a 5 mm steel sheet or vests, class 3 — all distance target shooting. These indicators are comparable to those of standard ammunition caliber 5.56 mm, 5.45 mm, with several times more muzzle energy.<br><br>

The iron sights include a front sight and sector sight, marked from 25 to 400 meters, installed on the casing of the muffler. In addition, on the left side of the receiver located rail for mounting of brackets for optical day and night sights, giving the opportunity to recognize targets at a distance up to 300 meters<br><br>
