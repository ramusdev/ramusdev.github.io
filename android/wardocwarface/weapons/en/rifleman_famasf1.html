<h4>Historical note</h4>

The Famas F1 is an assault rifle developed in France in 1971, the company "Manufacture d'armes de Saint-Etienne" and produced to this day.<br><br> 

In the early 70s in France, there was a need to change who was armed with self-loading rifle MAS 49/56. In 1971 designer Paul Tellier has developed a new rifle. She was designated Famas F1 (FR. Fusil Automatique Manufacture d'armes de Sent Etienne — automatic rifle arms factory in Saint Etienne).<br><br> 

The Famas F1 was the first European designed rifle chambered for 5.56, and second, officially adopted an assault rifle, executed on the system "bullpup".<br><br>

Carrying handle made up more than half the length of the rifle, because in addition to entirely protected and even fly. Through this arrangement it assault rifle Famas F1 immediately attached the nickname "Kleron" (FR. le Clairon — bugle).<br><br> 

Shooting with rifle Famas F1 can conduct both right and left shoulder. However, the permutation of ejector paddle was a complex operation that is not recommended to carry out in the field because of the great likelihood of loss of small parts. br><br>

Due to the semi retention paddle Famas F1 has a higher rate of fire than its "bullpoopie" sister Austrian rifle Steyr and British L85A1, but inferior to them in accuracy.<br><br> 

The trigger mechanism provides along with the modes single and auto fire ability to fire a fixed (three-shot) bursts. This mechanism has two switches.<br><br>

The trigger mechanism is a closed module that is placed in a plastic housing. It is attached to the wall of the receiver with pins that in case of breakage allows it to quickly replace.<br><br> 

Despite the fact that the Famas F1 was designed in 1971 to equip her armed forces began only in 1978. So long the adoption was due to the indecision of the French Ministry of defence — too unusual, different from the traditional self-loading rifles were the new weapons.<br><br> 

In 1980 the first 5 thousand units of weapons got the parachute part of the famous French foreign Legion.
