Marlin 1894 Custom - a new weapon of the medic, when you get acquainted with which you immediately remember two unique guns already presented in Warface. Like the" Saiga " Spike, the Marlin 1894 Custom is loaded not with the usual shot, but with a bullet cartridge, the so-called "slug" (slug).<br><br>



Well, reloading will certainly remind you of another symbol of the Wild West-the Winchester M1897.



<h4>Acquisition</h4>



The boar can be purchased in the game store for credits for a while or forever.



<h4>Combat Effectiveness</h4>



The Marlin 1894 Custom has a high range of fire and accuracy-both in the sight and from the hip. And the power of the shot is such that at close range it knocks over any opponent on his back, if you can not kill him with the first hit.



<h4>Advantages</h4>

- Good damage<br>

- High shooting accuracy<br>

- Good rate of fire<br>

- High range



< h4>Disadvantages</h4>

- No.



<h4>Historical background</h4>

The Marlin 1894 hunting rifle was developed by the American company Marlin Firearms Co. back in 1894. At that time, lever-action reloading weapons were gaining popularity, and American hunters were well-received with the new rifle with the "Henry bracket".<br><br>

The simple design provided fast reloading and high reliability in the field. Despite the external similarity with the "Winchesters" of that time, the Marlin 1894 had a number of differences in the design of the receiver, the bolt assembly and the locking assembly.<br><br>



The original Marlin 1894 weighed 2.95 kg with a length of 952 mm. She used caliber cartridges .44 Magnum and .44 Special, but today there are a large number of modifications for a variety of ammunition. <br><br>



Gunsmiths remake the classics of the Wild West beyond recognition, using modern technologies-Picattini bars, collimator sights, silent shooting devices, and so on.<br><br>
