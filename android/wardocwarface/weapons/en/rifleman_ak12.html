A modern machine gun designed to replace the legendary AK-74 in the Russian army. The weapon has many advantages over its predecessor, for example: reduced recoil, the ability to install modern sighting systems and thoughtful ergonomics. <br><br>



This model uses a caliber of 5.45x39 mm to increase the penetration capacity of the bullet.



<h4>Combat Effectiveness</h4>



The AK-12 has an easily controlled recoil and a high rate of fire. Special ammo allows you to deal increased damage to the limbs and additional damage at long range.<br><br>



The machine has a number of unique modules, and also deals increased damage to the limbs.<br><br>

<h4>Advantages</h4>

- High damage<br>

- High range<br>

- Easily controlled recoil<br>

- Three modification slots with unique modules<br>



<h4>Disadvantages</h4>

- Average accuracy when shooting from the hip



<h4>Historical background</h4>

The development of the new machine gun was carried out since June 2011 under the leadership of the chief designer of "Izhmash" Vladimir Zlobin on the basis of developments over the previous 10 years. <br><br>



In 2011, the assembly and testing of the first prototype of the fifth-generation Kalashnikov assault rifle with the working name AK-12 was completed. <br><br>



The slot machine was first shown in January 2012. The state did not support the development of a new machine gun due to the excessive number of old AK, which were in warehouses, in total, more than 17 million.<br><br>



On June 2, 2012, in Solnechnogorsk, Vladimir Zlobin, Chief Designer of NPO Izhmash, made a presentation of the AK-12 for the Interdepartmental Working Group (Laboratory) under the Military-Industrial Commission, which included representatives of the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the FSB of Russia. <br><br>



The members of the commission on the results of the demonstration shooting noted that the machine gun behaves more steadily when firing than the samples of previous generations: the recoil and withdrawal when firing bursts decreased.<br><br>



From June 27 to July 1, 2012, the second international forum "Technologies in Mechanical Engineering" was held in the city of Zhukovsky on the territory of the transport and exhibition complex "Russia", where the AK-12 was scheduled to be shown.<br><br>



During 2013-2014, the machine met with some opposition from the military under the pretext of numerous shortcomings, in connection with which the promising machine was denied state funding for testing.<br><br>



In 2016, in addition to the AK-12, an AK-15 machine gun with a 7.62×39 mm cartridge and a RPK-16 machine gun (5.45×39 mm) were also demonstrated.<br><br>



As of the beginning of 2017, the "3rd Central Research Institute of the Ministry of Defense" is still testing four submachine guns: AK-12, AK-15, A-545 (6P67) and A-762 (7P68).<br><br>



On January 29, 2018, the AK-12 was adopted by the Ground Forces, Airborne Forces and Marines of the Russian Federation.<br><br>
