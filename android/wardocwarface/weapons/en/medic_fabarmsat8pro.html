This brake consists of an elastic ring located between the gas piston and rods, leading to the bolt group.<br><br>



With vigorous movement of the gas piston (when using cartridges of large capacity, with high blood pressure in the barrel), the elastic ring is compressed in the longitudinal direction, thereby increasing friction with the tube store and slowing down the rate rollback movable parts down to acceptable values.<br><br>



Locking barrel by swinging larvae located in the gate and in firing position included in the groove in the shank of the barrel. The barrels have a proprietary drilling TriBore and are equipped with interchangeable chokes or muzzle brake / compensator.<br><br>
