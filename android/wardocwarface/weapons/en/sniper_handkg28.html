Semi-automatic sniper rifle The H&K G28 sniper rifle is designed and manufactured by the well-known German company Heckler & Koch commissioned by the Bundeswehr (German Army).



<h4>Acquisition</h4>



ACR SPR can be purchased in the game store in boxes of good luck.



<h4>Combat Effectiveness</h4>



The gaming characteristics of the H&K G28 are absolutely unique. It is completely different from all the sniper rifles in our game and has several interesting features. The most important of them will be the presence of its own collimator sight.<br><br>



Now the sniper can be effective not only at a long distance, but also at close range. Two shots from the H&K G28 in any part of the body will destroy the enemy, and one hit in the head is guaranteed to be fatal. The rifle is very malleable in handling. It has a soft recoil and a high rate of fire.<br><br>



The gold version will feature a slightly increased rate of fire and an increased magazine.



<h4>Advantages</h4>

- Excellent rate of fire<br>

- Excellent shooting accuracy from the hip<br>

- Unique modules<br>

- Three slots of modifications<br>

- High penetration capacity



<h4>Disadvantages</h4>

- Small store capacity



<h4>Historical background</h4>

The H&K G28 sniper rifle is designed and manufactured by the well-known German company Heckler & Koch commissioned by the Bundeswehr (German Army).<br><br>



The gun provides the infantry with the ability to conduct effective fire at ranges inaccessible to standard weapons of 5.56 mm caliber (about 400 meters and beyond), in conditions where the use of more powerful support weapons (machine guns, mortars, artillery, etc.) is not available or unacceptable for any reason.<br><br>



The rifle uses a gas-discharge automatic with a short stroke of the gas piston and a rotary shutter.<br><br>



 The two-position gas regulator ensures reliable operation of the weapon both in normal mode and with the use of a silencer of the sound of the shot. The trigger mechanism provides only a single fire.<br><br>

 The receiver of the rifle consists of two halves – the upper steel and the lower aluminum alloy. The barrel cantilever posted on the inside of the forearm. The rifle is used in several configurations, which can be changed in the conditions of a military base.<br><br>



 The standard configuration of the H&K G28 includes an extended forearm, a telescopic adjustable butt with a cheek, folding bipods, as well as a Schmidt & Bender PMII 3-20×50 optical sight and a laser rangefinder mounted on top of it.<br><br>
