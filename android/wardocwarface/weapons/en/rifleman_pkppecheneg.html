<h4>Historical note</h4>

PKP "Pecheneg" is a Russian single machine gun, developed in 1995 TSNIITOCHMASH. Designed to defeat manpower, fire weapons and vehicles, air targets.<br><br>

Based on designs taken 7.62‐mm machine gun Kalashnikov. This is enabled with minimal cost to begin production in 1999, as well as to simplify its operation. Overall, "Pecheneg" has retained up to 80% common parts with a PCM.<br><br>

Cannon group provides shooting 600 rounds in long bursts without compromising the effectiveness of the shooting. At conducting long battle machine gun can fire up to 10,000 rounds per hour with no degradation of combat performance and reduce the life of the barrel.<br><br>

"Pecheneg" can use the entire range of rifle cartridges of 7.62×54 mm R.<br><br>

The gun system is used for forced air cooling of the barrel due to the energy of powder gases. Adjustable venting mechanism allows the gun to operate in any climatic conditions. The life of the barrel is 25-30 thousand shots when shooting in intense modes.<br><br>

The barrel has outer fins and enclosed in a metal casing. The powder gases leaving the barrel, creating a vacuum zone in front of the casing. In the rear part of the casing is made of special ventilation Windows. Thus, during the shooting along the barrel continuously pumped cold air. The constant cooling of the barrel reduces the dispersion when firing, and also increases the durability of the trunk.<br><br>

Hardening of the barrel allowed me to move the bipod from the gas chamber to muzzle, which has increased base and reduced the dispersion to 70%, but this bipod is not always convenient, as this limits the sector of fire on the front without moving the arrow or weapon.<br><br>

The alignment of the temperature field of a trunk is allowed to increase its resources to the level specified for the whole machine gun, as well as to reduce the tilt of the aiming point during prolonged firing to a value equal to no more than 0.001 of a share range. This allowed to have a second barrel (although barrel mount "Pecheneg" remains the quick release) and despite the setting on the gun for more screen, to reduce the stowed weight of the weapon.<br><br>

In addition, the design of a machine gun "Pecheneg" can significantly reduce the harmful effect of the upward flow of the heated barrel of the air at the line of sight. High heat new gun visible in the dark even with the naked eye at the brightness of the barrel after shooting all the ammo.
