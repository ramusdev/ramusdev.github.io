The Degtyarev light machine gun (RPD) appeared back in 1944 and served as an infantry support weapon until the mid-sixties. It has an impressive firepower that can stop any enemy.

<h4>Advantages</h4>

- Excellent damage<br>

- Excellent range<br>

- Good rate of fire<br>

- Large store capacity<br>

- Three slots of modifications with a large range of equipment<br>

<h4>Historical background</h4>



The Degtyarev light machine gun (RPD) appeared back in 1944 and served as an infantry support weapon until the mid-sixties. The power is supplied from a 100-round cartridge belt placed in a round metal box.<br><br>

Thanks to the carrying belt, the machine gun allows you to shoot from the hip. After some time, the design appeared bipods and the ability to install on a tripod machine. All this makes the machine gun suitable for any situation.<br><br>



On the basis of this weapon, a number of modifications were created, including for the civilian market. In accordance with the latest trends, the weapon received a new "body kit" in the form of numerous Picatinny slats, modern sighting devices, telescopic butts, ergonomic handles and other modules.<br><br>



It is safe to say that the RPD is still a modern weapon that meets all the necessary requirements for combat.<br><br>

For example, the process of the M4A1 barrel has deeper feeding ramps that set the movement of cartridges when feeding from the store (the AR-15 family of weapons has two feeding ramps, separately for cartridges fed from the left and right rows of the store), and the receiver has additional recesses under them, which are absent from the M16.<br><br> 



Moreover, the process of the barrel from the M4A1 can be installed with the preservation of functioning in the receiver of the rifle, but not vice versa. There are other relatively minor differences.
