<h4>Historical note</h4>
AX308 sniper rifle with a longitudinally sliding rotary shutter. "US SOCOM" in February 2009 announced a tender for the development and delivery of a new sniper rifle "PSR".<br><br>

In terms of competition, manufacturers had to develop a small complex, fully satisfying the requirements and on March 3, 2010 to provide multiple samples for testing.<br><br>

The intention to participate in competition was expressed by many companies, among which was the famous English company "Accuracy International" (AI). However, none of the product AI did not meet the requirements of the competition and the company's management decided to develop a new sniper rifle model on the basis of the well proven series of "AW" for the specified customer.<br><br>

<img src="https://ramusdev.github.io/android/wardocwarface/weapons/image/sniper_ax308_3.jpg"></a><br><br>

The outcome of the work of the team of designers of AI was presented in January 2010 at the exhibition "SHOT Show" in Las Vegas a new sniper rifle lineup "AX" — AX308. The rifle passed all the formal criteria of the competition and was adopted to the test.<br><br>

The fore-end is an octagonal frame rigidly fixed on the carrier bus, faces which include attachment points. This design forend combines the ability to accommodate the bipod and sights with the effective removal of hot air from the trunk through the unused mounting holes.<br><br>

The barrel has a smooth external profile, or the profile valleys, with a length of 20 inches with different pitch of thread for different calibers. The barrel is installed in the receiver is screwed into the threads in the receiver, giving it additional rigidity.<br><br>

The receiver is mounted on a carrier rail — receiver is first glued with epoxy, and then screwed the bolts to the frame. On the top face of the receiver mounted rail-type Picatinny rail, designed for mounting various optical sights.<br><br>

The locking occurs by three lugs, the angle of rotation of the shutter is 60°, which reduces the reload time. An improved leaf spring of the ejector has an increased service life, which increases the reliability of his work.<br><br>

The extractor can remove or re-install using the tip of the bullet. The shutter is designed in such a way that taking out combat the larvae require only simple hand tools. Switching to another caliber is produced by the replacement of combat larvae or the whole shutter Assembly.<br><br>

The design of the shutter has a new fuse, which prevents the production of a shot at not fully latched gate. Fitted with a safety catch — three position: 1 position — the drummer is locked and the shutter locked; 2 — the drummer is locked, it is possible to extract the shutter; 3 — the readiness for firing.<br><br>

Slide group has de-icing coating and receiver and other metal parts — anticorosive.<br><br>

Food arms ammunition is from detachable box magazine capacity of 10 rounds. In the carrier the tyre is cut, which promotes greater comfort when handling the store.<br><br>

The stock has the adjustable head stock angle in the plane perpendicular to the axis of the rifle and the height adjustment along the length of the butt, due to the spacers and adjust the height of the cheeks.<br><br>

On both sides of the butt stock is equipped with antabok belt, and a monopod (for more emphasis) a new design in the cutout under the "weak" hand.<br><br>

In fact, the rifle model number AX, is an improved modification of the rifle series AW, inheriting the toughness, reliability, superb accuracy and ease of maintenance, and having high ergonomic quality and light weight.
