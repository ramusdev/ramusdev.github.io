In 2014, the American company Desert Tech (formerly Desert Tactical Arms) introduced a new gun of its own design, which received the designation MDR (Micro Dynamic Rifle).<br><br>



This is a modular multi-caliber automatic weapon, designed for arming special forces units of the police and army.<br>



The weapons were delivered to the arms market in two versions:<br><br>



MDR-with a barrel length of 16 inches (406 mm);<br><br>



MDR-C (Compact) - with a barrel length of 10.5 inches (267 mm).<br><br>

The Desert Tech MDR has a modular design with quick-change barrels of different calibers. <br><br>



By changing the barrel, the bolt and installing the appropriate adapter in the magazine receiver, it can easily adapt to cartridges of different sizes and capacities (the main ones are 7. 62x51 mm and 5. 56x45 mm), which < br><br>



Allows you to transform the weapon into an automatic rifle or submachine gun.<br><br>

All controls, including the safety check box, the slide delay button, and the magazine release button, are located on both sides of the receiver. <br><br>



Therefore, the Desert Tech MDR / MDR-C is an ambidextral weapon (shooting is possible from both the right and left shoulder). <br><br>



Thanks to the floating barrel, this gun has a high accuracy of shooting.
