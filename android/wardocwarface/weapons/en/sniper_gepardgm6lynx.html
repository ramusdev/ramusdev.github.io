Hungarian sniper rifle, made in the bull-pop configuration. For its caliber, it is characterized by compact dimensions.



<h4>Acquisition</h4>



It is delivered for warbucks forever, after opening from suppliers ("Legendary").



<h4>Combat Effectiveness</h4>



The large-caliber sniper rifle Gepard GM6 Lynx has a fairly compact size, which allows you to conduct a very comfortable shooting with your hands, without the use of bipods.<br><br>



This is a semi-automatic weapon, characterized by high damage and excellent accuracy. GM6 Lynx is sure to appeal to fans of the PvP mode: the chance to destroy any enemy with one shot and the ability to quickly correct a miss make it a formidable weapon.<br><br>



Also, this rifle comes with a unique module — a 4.6-fold Schmidt & Bender sight with an increased speed of entering the aiming mode.



<h4>Advantages</h4>

- Good damage<br>

 Is a pretty good range of objectives<br>

- High rate of fire<br>

- High penetration<br>

- Unique optical sight with accelerated entry into the aiming mode



<h4>Disadvantages</h4>

- Small store capacity



<h4>Historical background</h4>

The Lynx GM-6 sniper rifle was developed by the Hungarian company Sero in 2007. It has a fairly compact size for weapons of 12.7 mm caliber.<br><br>



The use of an effective muzzle brake significantly reduces the peak recoil felt by the shooter, so the rifle allows you to comfortably conduct aimed shooting from the hands, without the use of bipods or other support.<br><br>

The power of this rifle eloquently speaks of its main purpose. <br><br>



This is the defeat of lightly armored vehicles, radio-electronic structures, rocket launchers, the enemy in shelters and buildings, as well as helicopters in hover mode at a distance of up to 600-800 meters.<br><br>



Fired from a Gepard GM6 Lynx, a conventional bullet penetrates a 25-centimeter concrete wall at a distance of 100 meters, and an armor-piercing bullet penetrates 2 cm thick steel armor at the same distance.<br><br>



Another advantage of this rifle is the ease of changing the caliber: after replacing the barrel, bolt and magazine, the Lynx GM6 can be used as "Western" cartridges 12.7×99 (.50 BMG), and domestic 12. 7x108.<br><br>
