<h4>Historical note</h4>
Skorpion vz. 83 — Czech submachine gun, designed for tank weapons, communications and soldiers of other specialties, the company "Ceska Zbrojovka" ("CZ"). Skorpion was adopted in Czechoslovakia in 1983 (hence the designation vz. 83 — vzor 83, that is, the sample 1983).<br><br>

The first model of this PP was adopted by the Czech army in 1961 and was named Skorpion vz. 61. The basis of arms was a scheme with a free gate, with the use of a light shutter is provided at a relatively high rate of fire.<br><br>

Used even special hooks on the rear side of the receiver and the handle of the weapon to reduce the rate of fire. This decision led to a decrease in accuracy, but in this case it was not significant, since the weapon was originally developed for use on very small distances.<br><br>

Also the convenience of shooting in a melee was facilitated by the small dimensions of PP.<br><br>

Early model Skorpion used cartridges of caliber 7,65х17 mm low power. Subsequently, the caliber of ammunition used multiple times has varied from model to model. For example, the following model PP variant 1968 (Skorpion vz. 68) was fed by cartridges of caliber of 9×19 mm Parabellum, model 1982 (Skorpion vz. 82) — pistol cartridges 9×18 mm.<br><br>

Modification of the 1983 (Skorpion vz. 83) have already used the ammunition 9×17 mm.<br><br>

Usually this caliber is rarely used in army units, but has found very wide application in the world of weapons for law enforcement officers and civilians. Although not the most stopping power, the bullet has a very high initial velocity.<br><br>

And if you add to this advantage, little impact, then we have a cartridge with excellent performance shooting accuracy.<br><br>

Is in service with the army and the police of the Czech Republic. Skorpion vz. 83 found wide application in the countries of Africa and the Middle East: weapons were exported to Egypt, Libya, Angola, Iraq and several other countries.
