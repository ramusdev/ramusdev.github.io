<h4>Historical background</h4>

The Typhoon F12 is an innovative 12-gauge semi-automatic rifle with a gas-discharge reloading system. It is distinctive that the F12 is made in the layout of the AR platform and almost completely repeats its controls, allowing practical shooters to apply the skills of handling weapons already worked out on "black" rifles.<br><br>

Nevertheless, the internal differences from the "arches" are quite significant. The gas chamber, piston and return spring are located directly around the barrel of the weapon, making it possible to reduce the diameter of the forearm and make it more grasping.<br><br>



The gas mechanism is self-cleaning, which allows you to operate the gun for a long time without cleaning. The adaptable gas chamber can be adjusted for light (up to 28 grams) and heavy shot weights to ensure stable operation of the system.<br><br>



The barrel of the gun has a length of 47 centimeters, made of steel grade 4140. The inner bore is chrome-plated. To simplify the handling of weapons and maximum control during rapid firing, a muzzle brake is installed on the barrel, which significantly reduces the barrel toss (in the Sport version).<br><br>

On the receiver, made of aluminum alloy of the 7075-T6 brand, as well as on the cantilever forearm, there are Picatinny/Weaver bars of the MIL – 1913 standard for installing sighting devices and shooting accessories (additional handles, flashlights, laser designators, etc.).<br><br>



The gun safety is double-sided, the trigger mechanism is single-stage with the ability to adjust the trigger force. The rifle is equipped with a Mil-Spec standard butt adapter tube with the possibility of replacing it with analogues from other manufacturers, as well as replacing the butt with another type suitable for the adapter.<br><br>



The pistol grip of the rifle is interchangeable with similar, compatible AR-based carbines.<br><br>



The rifle is normally equipped with a plastic case, folding sighting devices-the whole and the front sight, as well as a telescopic butt with an adjustable cheek.<br><br>



The gun is powered from detachable single-row box magazines with a capacity of 2, 5 or 10 rounds.<br><br>



The Typhoon F12 rifle is an excellent option for self-defense, entertainment and practical shooting, and the affordable price makes it affordable for the Ukrainian market.<br><br><br><br>
