<h4>Historical note</h4>
MAG-7 — smooth-bore shotgun developed by the South African company Techno Arms Pty specifically as a combat weapon for a melee, especially for operations in confined spaces.<br><br>

Normal combat shotguns have the necessary firepower and stopping action for melee, but most of them are too long or have shops of small capacity, so designers from South Africa took as a starting point in creating my gun is not a traditional pump-action shotgun, and a relatively compact submachine gun of the Israeli UZI or South Africa business BXP.<br><br>

The gun got stamped steel receiver and detachable box magazine in the handle. To ensure a reasonable size of store and the arm had to abandon the use of conventional ammunition 12 gauge in favor of rounds shortened to 60 mm sleeve. Thus, the tactical niche of the MAG-7 is an agile urban combat in small and ultrasmall distances.<br><br>

Structurally, the MAG-7 is pretty simple. Short barrel attached to the receiver sleeve on the thread. Locking barrel — a massive gate with a swinging combat larva in the upper part, will for the cutout in the cover of the receiver. Control loading — with a longitudinally sliding forearm through the flat rod passing through the bottom of the receiver and connecting the forearm with a paddle.<br><br>

Trigger mechanism — the trigger has a manual safety in the form of a lever on the left side of the receiver. The forearm has a push button locking mechanism, precluding its movement and, therefore, undesirable unlocking of the shutter when moving with the weapon in his hands.<br><br>

Food — from single-row detachable box magazine for 5 rounds, additionally, cartridges with casing of 70 mm. can be inserted one at a time directly into the chamber through the window to eject shell casings on the right side of the receiver.<br><br>

In the basic configuration, the MAG-7 is designed for firing with it, offhand, and has no butt, but at the request of the customer can be set up folding metal shoulder rest.<br><br>

As due to small overall dimensions and short stem MAG-7 legally prohibited from civil circulation in many countries (including Russia), especially for the civilian market available variant rifles MAG-7M1 with extended up to 500 mm. barrel and integral spike wooden stock.<br><br>

This weapon can seriously be regarded only as a curiosity, as loses almost all its advantages (small size, maneuverability) while maintaining the disadvantages (large mass and low power Chuck, not too comfortable grip).<br><br>

The disadvantages are shortening the sleeve, which reduced the power of the cartridge, pistol grip, MAG-7 is too wide for the gunners with a medium brush size. The relatively heavy weight of the weapon contributes to shooting accuracy, but does not fit well with the requirements of shooting with a hand in the melee.
