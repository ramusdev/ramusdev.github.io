English sniper rifle caliber .50 BMG, developed by Accuracy International for the British army. AS50 provides a huge range of fire without loss of accuracy.

<h4>Purchase</h4>

Comes in boxes of luck for the loans forever or for a certain period of time.

<h4>Battle performance</h4>

AS50 is a large-caliber semi-automatic rifle with enormous destructive power and good rate of fire.<br><br>

This sniper rifle always kills in one shot if the enemy is not wearing armour with protection from the first hit or (on the extremities) with excellent protection from bullets.<br><br>

Minus the rifle — a poorly controlled impact with a large amplitude (the first bullet flies right on target, and all subsequent already in "milk").

<h4>Advantages</h4>
- Good rate of fire<br>
- Great damage<br>
- Acceptable accuracy when firing from the hip<br>
- 2 slots for modifications<br>

<h4>Disadvantages</h4>
- High performance<br>
- Long cooldown
