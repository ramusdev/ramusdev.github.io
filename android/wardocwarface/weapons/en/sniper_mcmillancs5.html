The use of subsonic ammunition 0.308 Winchester CS5 allows to reach the accuracy of 0.2 mrad (0.75 of a minute of a degree), and in urban areas it can be even better. The same accuracy could be achieved with a typical 7.62 mm NATO ammunition.<br><br>

Thus, the firearm can be used with subsonic ammunition, and in the role of a traditional sniper rifle.
