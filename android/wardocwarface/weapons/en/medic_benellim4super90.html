<h4>Battle performance</h4>

In contrast to the same SPAS-12, you will always have time to finish off the enemy second shot and can easily stir up a crowd of rivals. But don't overdo: no ammunition will not let you shoot for too long, 6 rounds is too little.<br><br>

The use of this weapon is allowed in tournaments Warface.
