The legendary Degtyarev machine gun, the main weapon of fire support of the Red Army infantry.



<h4>Acquisition</h4>



A unique weapon that can be obtained for the celebration of May 9.



<h4>Combat Effectiveness</h4>

In Warface, the DP-27 is a weapon with very high damage and good shooting accuracy in the scope. The gold version is characterized by increased range, rate of fire and magazine capacity.<br><br>

Earlier in the game there was another machine gun from the same designer — RPD Custom.



<h4>Advantages</h4>

- Excellent range<br>

- Good rate of fire<br>

- High penetration capacity



<h4>Disadvantages</h4>

- Low accuracy shooting from the hip<br>

- One slot of modifications<br>

- Small magazine (for a machine gun)



<h4>Historical background</h4>



DP-27 (Degtyareva Infantry model 1927) became the first domestic light machine gun of mass production.<br><br>



Its first samples were made at the Kovrov Factory on November 12, 1927, then a batch of 100 machine guns went to military tests, according to the results of which on December 21, 1927, the weapon was adopted by the Red Army.<br><br>

The barrel of the machine gun had 6 rifling holes and was located in the casing, which provided protection for the shooter from burns during firing. The stock was made of wood, it was located in the oilcan and spare parts for the care of weapons.<br><br>



Cartridges of the 7.62 x 54 mm caliber were placed in separate places in the disc magazine and did not cling to the neighboring ones with the edge, as happened in the carob magazines.<br><br>



A special design with a front sight informed the fighter about how many rounds were left in the disk. If necessary, the store could be disassembled and cleaned of dirt. One of the main advantages of the machine gun is its reliability in difficult operating conditions.<br><br>
